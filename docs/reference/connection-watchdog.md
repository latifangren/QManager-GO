The Connection Watchdog (`qmanager_watchcat`) is a self-healing daemon that watches the modem's internet reachability and, when the link stays down, climbs a four-step recovery ladder from the gentlest fix (re-register to the network) to the most disruptive (reboot the device). It never pings on its own — it is a pure *state machine* that reads the verdict already produced by the ping daemon (`qmanager_ping`) and decides what to do about it. Its headline capability is **Tier-3 SIM failover**: on a dual-SIM RM520N-GL it can swap to the backup SIM slot when the primary carrier goes dark, ride on it, and later revert. This document describes the watchdog exactly as it ships on the RM520N-GL.

> ℹ️ NOTE: "Watchcat" (the daemon/binary name) and "Watchdog" (the UI name) refer to the same feature. The backend script, systemd unit, and config section all use `watchcat`; the page and copy say "Watchdog".

## How it works

### The state machine

The daemon runs one loop on a `check_interval` cadence (default 10s), transitioning between these states:

```
MONITOR ──streak_fail>0──▶ SUSPECT ──streak_fail ≥ fail_threshold──▶ RECOVERY ──▶ COOLDOWN ──▶ MONITOR
   ▲                          │  (connectivity restored naturally)                     │
   └──────────────────────────┘◀────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
LOCKED    — maintenance mode; sleeps until the lock clears
DISABLED  — turned off (config, or auto-disabled by the Tier-4 cap)
```

- **MONITOR** — the healthy resting state. Reads `qmanager_ping.json` each cycle; if the ping daemon reports any failure streak (`streak_fail > 0`) it moves to SUSPECT.
- **SUSPECT** — the decision window. The watchdog compares the ping daemon's **raw `streak_fail`** — the count of consecutive failed *probes* the daemon has already tallied — directly against `fail_threshold`. A clean read (`reachable=true` and `streak_fail == 0`) returns straight to MONITOR; when `streak_fail ≥ fail_threshold` the watchdog declares the connection down and enters RECOVERY. This is why the UI previews "declares down after ~`probe_interval × fail_threshold`s" — the daemon probes every `probe_interval` seconds, so it takes roughly that many probes to reach the threshold.

> ℹ️ NOTE — the double-debounce fix: the watchdog now trusts the ping daemon's `streak_fail` as the single count of consecutive failures, rather than re-counting its own loop cycles on top of the daemon's already-debounced signal. Previously each side counted independently (the daemon debounced its probes into a verdict, *then* the watchdog counted its own passes on top), so the real time-to-recovery was the product of two debounce windows and drifted far from what the UI advertised. `check_interval` is now purely the watchdog's internal *sampling* cadence — how often it wakes to re-read the cache — and is no longer the unit the down-declaration is measured in; the probe cadence (`probe_interval`) is what governs detection timing.
- **RECOVERY** — runs the current tier's action (see the ladder below), then drops into COOLDOWN. It doesn't linger here.
- **COOLDOWN** — waits for the action to settle, then re-reads the ping verdict to decide success or escalation (see *Cooldown adjudication*).
- **LOCKED** — set whenever a maintenance condition is present: the lock file `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.lock` exists (touched by the OTA updater and installer), a long-running AT command is in flight (`/tmp/qmanager_long_running`), or a SIM-profile apply is running (`/tmp/qmanager_profile_apply.pid` points at a live process). The watchdog parks here so its AT commands never race those operations.
- **DISABLED** — `watchcat.enabled=0`, or the daemon shut itself off after tripping the Tier-4 reboot cap.

<a id="carrier-intercept-short-circuit-now-inert"></a>
> ℹ️ NOTE — carrier-intercept short-circuit is now **inert** (v0.1.32): the watchdog still contains a branch that short-circuits recovery when the ping daemon reports `connectivity=limited` (a captive/billing portal). After the [ICMP producer port](connection-quality.md#why-the-tri-state-is-gone), `qmanager_ping` **no longer emits `connectivity` or `limited` at all** — an ICMP echo either answers or it doesn't. The branch is therefore dead code that never fires; it was left in place as harmless (no behavior change) rather than ripped out. **The recovery ladder is unaffected** — it keys off `streak_fail`, which the new ICMP producer still emits, so genuine-outage detection and recovery are intact.

### The escalation engine

`find_next_tier` walks the enabled tiers in order (1→4). SUSPECT breaching the threshold runs the first enabled tier; each failed COOLDOWN escalates to the next enabled one. When the last enabled tier still doesn't restore connectivity, the watchdog gives up gracefully and returns to MONITOR (it does not loop forever).

Each tier's return code drives the engine:
- **`0`** — action attempted → enter COOLDOWN and judge the result.
- **`1`** — tier skipped (a guard fired, e.g. tower lock on Tier 2, or an unreadable slot on Tier 3) → immediately try the next enabled tier.
- **`2`** — **misconfiguration** (Tier 3 only) → **stop the ladder outright** (see below).

### Cooldown adjudication

When the cooldown timer expires, `finish_cooldown` re-reads the ping cache to decide whether the recovery worked:

1. **Fresh read, reachable** → success. Reset to MONITOR. If this was a Tier-3 swap, *finalize* the failover (below).
2. **Fresh read, unreachable** → failure. If Tier 3, revert the SIM first; then escalate to the next enabled tier.
3. **Stale/missing ping data** → the ping daemon's cache can go transiently stale right after a radio or SIM churn. Rather than misjudging that as a failure, the watchdog **retries up to 3 times**, extending the cooldown by one `check_interval` each round. Only after 3 stale rounds does it treat the recovery as failed — and it does so *without* consulting the stale `reachable` value (which predates the cooldown and could read a spurious "true").

---

## The recovery tiers in detail

### Tier 1 — Re-register to Network (`AT+COPS=2` → `AT+COPS=0`)

Deregisters from the carrier, then triggers automatic re-registration. The gentlest nudge — it shakes loose a stuck registration without dropping the radio. Always attempted first when enabled.

### Tier 2 — Restart Modem Radio (`AT+CFUN=0` → `AT+CFUN=1`)

Turns the radio off (airplane mode) and back on. `CFUN` is the modem's "functionality" control — `0` is minimum-functionality (radio off), `1` is full. After bringing the radio back, the watchdog waits for the modem to answer AT commands again (`wait_for_modem`, up to 60s).

> ⚠️ WARNING: Tier 2 is **skipped when a tower lock is active** (`/etc/qmanager/tower_lock.json` has LTE or NR-SA locking enabled). Cycling the radio would drop the locked cells you deliberately pinned, so the watchdog refuses to and escalates instead. It's also skipped while a long-running AT command holds the modem.

### Tier 3 — Switch to Backup SIM (the Golden Rule)

The most involved tier. On a dual-SIM RM520N-GL (`AT+QUIMSLOT=?` → `(1,2)`), it fails over to the configured backup slot when the primary SIM's carrier is unreachable.

**Prechecks (return `2`, stop the ladder):**
- No `backup_sim_slot` configured.
- The configured backup slot equals the current live slot (nothing to fail over to).

**The Golden Rule sequence** — the mandatory order for *any* SIM-slot switch on this modem:

```
AT+CFUN=0            # radio off (abort the whole swap if this fails)
  sleep 2
AT+QUIMSLOT=<slot>   # select the backup slot
  sleep 2
AT+CFUN=1            # radio back on
```

Around that core sequence, Tier 3:
1. **Captures the original slot's ICCID first** (`AT+QCCID`, 3× 1s retry) *before* detaching, so the failover record has an honest `original_iccid` instead of an empty placeholder. Best-effort — if it stays unreadable, the swap proceeds anyway.
2. Records `original_sim_slot` for a possible revert.
3. Stops the tower-failover daemon (`qmanager_tower_failover`) — cell locks are meaningless on a different SIM.
4. Runs the Golden Rule sequence, then `wait_for_modem`.
5. **Read-back verifies the slot actually landed** via `verify_quimslot` (`slot_verify.sh`) — `AT+QUIMSLOT=N` can return `OK` while the modem silently stays on the old slot under `qcmd` lock contention, so the write is never trusted on its own. `verify_quimslot` polls `AT+QUIMSLOT?` up to 10× (1s apart); an **empty** read counts as not-yet-matched, never a false success. On a verify failure the watchdog falls straight to `sim_failover_fallback()` (no second write-retry at this layer) rather than proceeding on an unconfirmed slot.
6. **Verifies the backup SIM is actually present** with `AT+CPIN?`, **retried 3 times one second apart**, mirroring the ICCID retry loop in step 1. Failure means `rc != 0` or empty stdout, never the literal text `ERROR`: `qcmd` reports failure by exit status and stderr and never writes `ERROR` to stdout ([at-command-transport.md](at-command-transport.md)). A response that is *present* but is not `+CPIN: READY` is a real "SIM present, not usable" state (PIN or PUK required); it is logged with the actual state rather than as "No SIM", and still falls back, because a locked SIM cannot carry traffic either way. Any of those outcomes falls back to the original slot.

   > ⚠️ WARNING: the retry is load-bearing, not defensive padding. `AT+CPIN?` fired immediately after the `AT+CFUN=1` in the Golden Rule sequence can legitimately answer `+CME ERROR: 14` ("SIM busy") while SIM initialisation is still running, and `wait_for_modem` only waits for bare `AT` to answer, which happens well before the SIM is ready. A single failed read is therefore routine rather than proof the slot is empty. Before 2026-08-23 this check tested `grep -q 'ERROR'` against stdout, which could never match, so the fallback below it had **never executed in production**; fixing the detection (`b4d87ef`) activated it, and a one-shot read would have made the last rung of the recovery ladder revert a *working* failover back to the dead primary SIM.
7. Does **not** write the failover state yet — it waits for cooldown to confirm the backup SIM actually carries traffic.

**SIM-settle floor (`SIM_SETTLE_SECS = 90`):** after a Tier-3 swap the cooldown is `max(cooldown, 90)` seconds. A real SIM swap needs time to re-attach and get a data bearer on the new carrier; judging it "failed" after a short 10–60s cooldown would wrongly bounce a swap that was still coming up. The floor only applies to Tier 3.

**Finalize (in cooldown, on success):** when connectivity comes back on the backup SIM, the daemon writes `/etc/qmanager/qmanager_sim_failover`, emits a **"SIM failover confirmed"** event, registers the landed ICCID in the known-SIMs set (below), and auto-applies any SIM profile matching the new card.

**Fallback (revert to original):** triggered when the modem is unresponsive after the swap, the backup slot's SIM state cannot be confirmed after 3 attempts or comes back as anything other than `+CPIN: READY`, or cooldown finds the backup SIM still can't reach the internet. It **read-back verifies the revert landed** via `verify_quimslot(original_sim_slot)` before trusting it — same rationale as the Tier-3 switch gate, and the same "no second write-retry, fall through to best-effort handling" posture on a verify failure (an unconfirmed revert emits an error event asking for a manual check rather than looping). Once verified, it restarts the tower-failover daemon, registers the reverted ICCID in the known-SIMs set, and re-applies that SIM's profile.

### Tier 4 — Reboot Device (deferred)

The last resort: a full device reboot, guarded by a **token bucket**.

- `count_recent_reboots` counts `reboot` entries in `/etc/qmanager/crash.log` from the last hour.
- If that count is already at `max_reboots_per_hour`, the watchdog **does not reboot**. Instead it sets `enabled=0` in config, touches `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat_disabled`, and exits — a reboot loop is worse than a down link, so it stops itself and surfaces an auto-disabled banner in the UI.
- Otherwise it appends a timestamped line to `crash.log` (format `<epoch>|reboot|tier4_escalation`, trimmed to the last 20 entries), records the recovery, flushes state, and reboots after a 1s grace.

> ℹ️ NOTE: The reboot is issued through `run_reboot` after the state file is flushed. The watchdog runs *on* the modem, so this is the deferred pattern the platform requires — state is written before the device goes down, never mid-request.

---

## Misconfiguration stops the ladder (return code 2)

If Tier 3 is enabled but misconfigured — **no backup slot**, or **backup slot equals the current slot** — `execute_tier3` returns code `2`, and `do_recovery` **halts the recovery ladder** instead of escalating. It logs the misconfiguration, emits a `watchcat_recovery` error event, clears the recovery flag, and returns to MONITOR.

**Why:** a bad Tier-3 config is an operator mistake, not a connectivity problem. Cascading it into a Tier-4 reboot would punish the device for a settings error — reboots wouldn't fix the config and could loop.

> ⚠️ WARNING — the tradeoff: if Tier 3 is the **first enabled tier** and it's misconfigured, the ladder stops *before* Tier 4, so **Tier 4 (reboot) becomes unreachable through that path** until you either fix the backup slot or disable Tier 3. The UI guards against creating this state — enabling Tier 3 with no backup slot **blocks the save** — but a config edited by hand can still land here.

---

## Configuration

Config lives in `/etc/qmanager/qmanager.conf` under `[watchcat]`, read/written via `qm_config_get`/`qm_config_set`. The daemon reloads it live when the CGI touches `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat_reload`.

| Key | Type | CGI-validated range | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|--------------------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool (0/1) | — | off | Master enable. Saving toggles the systemd unit (enable+start / stop+disable). |
| `fail_threshold` | int | 1–20 | 5 | Consecutive failed **probes** before recovery — compared directly against the ping daemon's raw `streak_fail`. Renamed from the retired `max_failures` (which counted the watchdog's own loop cycles). |
| `probe_interval` | int (s) | 1–60 | 5 | Probe cadence — how often the ping daemon probes. **The Watchdog is the sole writer**; on save it is propagated into `/etc/qmanager/ping_profile.json`'s `.interval_sec`. |
| `check_interval` | int (s) | 5–60 | 10 | The watchdog's internal *sampling* loop — how often it wakes to re-read the ping cache. No longer drives the down-declaration timing (that's `probe_interval × fail_threshold`). The UI offers 5 / 10 / 15 / 30. |
| `cooldown` | int (s) | 10–300 | 60 | Wait after each recovery step before re-checking (Tier 3 is floored at 90s). |
| `tier1_enabled` | bool | — | on | Enable Tier 1 (re-register). |
| `tier2_enabled` | bool | — | on | Enable Tier 2 (radio toggle). |
| `tier3_enabled` | bool | — | off | Enable Tier 3 (SIM failover). |
| `tier4_enabled` | bool | — | on | Enable Tier 4 (reboot). |
| `backup_sim_slot` | `1` \| `2` \| `null` | `1`/`2`/null | null | SIM slot to fail over to. Required when Tier 3 is on. |
| `max_reboots_per_hour` | int | 1–10 | 3 | Tier-4 token-bucket cap. Auto-disable trips when hit. |

> ℹ️ NOTE: The failure-count key is now `fail_threshold` (the retired `max_failures` is migrated away — see *Migrations* below). There are still **no** `quality_*`, `ssr_*`, or `primary_recheck_*` keys on the RM520N-GL; quality-trigger, SSR-aware-hold, and auto-failback are not implemented here.

### Split ownership of the probe cadence

`probe_interval` is stored in **two** places, with the Watchdog as the single source of truth:

1. `watchcat.probe_interval` in `qmanager.conf` — the canonical value the Watchdog's Detection tab reads and writes.
2. `.interval_sec` in `/etc/qmanager/ping_profile.json` — what the ping daemon (`qmanager_ping`) actually consumes.

On every save, `watchdog.sh` propagates (1) into (2) via an **atomic jq key-merge** (read the existing JSON, set only `.interval_sec`, temp-file + `mv`) and touches **both** `/tmp/qmanager_ping_reload` (so the ping daemon re-reads its cadence) and `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat_reload` (so the watchdog re-reads its config). The merge never overwrites the whole file, so it can't clobber the `profile`/`target_ipv4`/`target_ipv6` keys that the Connection Quality "Probe Targets" card owns independently in the same file (see [Ping source / split ownership](#ping-source--split-ownership)).

`propagate_probe_interval()` (`watchdog.sh:73-95`) guards the existing file with `jq -e 'type == "object"'` before merging and falls back to `{}` on failure, because a merge *indexes* what it reads — anything that isn't an object (malformed, empty, whitespace-only, `null`, scalar, array) aborts jq. This path is best-effort and already swallows stderr, so before the guard an aborted jq failed **silently**: the log recorded it, the user still saw a successful save, and the cadence never reached the daemon. The success condition also requires `[ -s "${PING_PROFILE_CONFIG}.tmp" ]` so a zero-byte temp is never promoted.

> ⚠️ WARNING — `jq -e .` is the **wrong** predicate here and must not be substituted in: `-e` tests output truthiness, so it passes `5`/`"str"`/`[1,2]` (unmergeable) and rejects `null`/`false` (parseable). The other writer of this same file carries the identical guard for the identical reason — full rationale, rc matrix, and test coverage in [connection-quality.md → Corrupt-config guard](connection-quality.md#corrupt-config-guard). Change one writer's guard and you must change both.

### Migrations (hand-written — `config.sh` has no key-migration primitive)

`qm_config_*` only seeds an empty config; it has no rename/migrate step, so the `max_failures` → `fail_threshold` rename is handled by two idempotent, defensive migrations:

- **Installer** (`install_rm520n.sh` → `migrate_watchcat_fail_threshold`, run on every install/OTA): if `fail_threshold` is unset and `max_failures` is set, copy the value across and delete the old key; if both are unset, seed `fail_threshold=5`; if `fail_threshold` is already present, just prune any leftover `max_failures`. It also seeds `probe_interval=5` (the daemon's relaxed-profile default) when unset.
- **Runtime** (`watchdog.sh` → `migrate_fail_threshold`, run on both GET and the save's Pass 2): covers a device that hits the CGI *before* the installer migration runs — same copy-across-then-delete logic, idempotent (returns immediately once `fail_threshold` is present).

The delete side uses the new `qm_config_delete` primitive added to `config.sh` in this change.

## State and flag files

**Persistent (`/etc/qmanager/`, survives reboot):**

| Path | Written by | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `qmanager_sim_failover` | daemon (write on finalize / revert), CGI (read), poller (re-emit into `status.json`) | Active SIM-failover record. Persistent so a Tier-4 reboot doesn't lose the fact that you're riding the backup SIM. |
| `known_iccids` | daemon (`sim_db_add`, on finalize + revert), poller (boot detector, also `sim_db_add`), `cellular/settings.sh` (manual slot switch), `profile_mgr.sh` (`set_active_profile`) | The known-SIMs **set** (replaces the retired single-value `last_iccid`). Every code path that lands the modem on a different SIM must add that ICCID here, or the poller's boot-time detector treats the (expected) transition as a physical swap. See [sim-detection.md](sim-detection.md) for the full model, including why a set (not a single value) is required for failover slot-cycling to never false-fire. |
| `crash.log` | daemon (Tier 4) | Pipe-delimited reboot log (`<epoch>\|reboot\|tier4_escalation`), last 20 entries. Source for the token-bucket count. |
| `tower_lock.json` | tower-lock feature | Read-only guard: Tier 2 is skipped when LTE or NR-SA locking is enabled. |

**Volatile (`/tmp/`, cleared on reboot):**

| Path | Written by | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `qmanager_watchcat.json` | daemon | Live state file (schema below). Read by the CGI (`status`) and the poller. |
| `qmanager_watchcat.pid` | daemon | Singleton guard. |
| `qmanager_watchcat.lock` | OTA updater / installer | Forces LOCKED (maintenance). |
| `qmanager_watchcat_reload` | CGI (`save_settings`) | Signals a live config reload. |
| `qmanager_watchcat_revert_sim` | CGI (`revert_sim`) | User-requested SIM revert; consumed by the daemon. |
| `qmanager_watchcat_disabled` | daemon (Tier-4 auto-disable) | Read by the CGI as `auto_disabled`; cleared when the user re-enables. |
| `qmanager_recovery_active` | daemon **and** `qmanager_profile_apply` | Set during any recovery; suppresses event noise (and, via `qmanager_ping`'s `during_recovery`, every alert) while acting. **Shared with another writer that may be a different UID** — see below. |
| `qmanager_sim_swap_detected` | poller (boot detector) | Physical-SIM-swap notification surfaced in the UI; distinct from watchdog failover. |
| `qmanager_ping.json` | `qmanager_ping` | The connectivity verdict the watchdog reads (never writes). |

#### Raising `qmanager_recovery_active` is a two-step idiom

The daemon raises the flag at six sites (Tiers 1/2/3, `do_recovery`, the
cooldown-stale extension, and the SIM revert) with the same line:

```sh
printf '%s\n' "$$" > "$RECOVERY_FLAG" 2>/dev/null || touch "$RECOVERY_FLAG"
```

Both halves are load-bearing, and neither is defensive padding:

- **The PID** lets `qmanager_profile_apply` — the other writer of this flag —
  judge it on its own merits (live owner / dead owner / aged out) instead of
  special-casing an empty file as "some foreign owner, never touch". Older
  builds wrote a bare `touch` with no PID, and an OTA can leave an old watchcat
  running against a new worker, so an **empty** flag is still a valid live state
  that must be left alone.
- **The `touch` fallback** is required. Watchcat is root, and if a `www-data`
  `qmanager_profile_apply` created the flag first, root's redirect is **refused**
  by `fs.protected_regular=1` — a sticky world-writable directory refuses an
  `O_CREAT` write unless you own the file or the file is owned by the directory's
  owner, and there is no root override. `touch` on that same file still succeeds,
  because stamping mtime only needs `CAP_FOWNER`. Since the flag's *existence* is
  what every consumer reads, dropping the fallback would mean root silently
  failing to raise suppression at all.

Re-stamping the mtime on each cooldown extension also keeps the flag from ageing
out of the worker's 120 s staleness ceiling during a long cooldown.

> ℹ️ NOTE: known residual, out of scope — if watchcat joins a flag a `www-data`
> APN bracket already owns, that bracket clears it at its end and watchcat's
> suppression stops early. Fixing that needs a multi-owner protocol, not a bigger
> flag. The claim protocol and the ownership rules are in
> [tmp-file-ownership.md](tmp-file-ownership.md); the worker side is in
> [sim-profiles.md](sim-profiles.md).

### Live state file — `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat.json`

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1721390000,
  "enabled": true,
  "state": "monitor",
  "current_tier": 0,
  "failure_count": 0,
  "last_recovery_time": null,
  "last_recovery_tier": null,
  "total_recoveries": 0,
  "cooldown_remaining": 0,
  "sim_failover_active": false,
  "original_sim_slot": null,
  "current_sim_slot": null,
  "reboots_this_hour": 0
}
```

> ℹ️ NOTE: `sim_failover_active` is a real boolean. It was previously written with a jq type mismatch that pinned it to `false`; it now reflects the actual failover state, so the UI's "Running on backup SIM" affordances light up correctly.

### SIM-failover record — `/etc/qmanager/qmanager_sim_failover`

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "original_slot": 1,
  "current_slot": 2,
  "switched_at": 1721390100,
  "reason": "connectivity_failure",
  "original_iccid": "8901…1234",
  "current_iccid": "8901…5678"
}
```

**Startup resume with slot verification:** on start, if this file says `active:true`, the daemon queries the *live* slot (`AT+QUIMSLOT?`) and compares it to the recorded `current_slot`. If they match, it resumes the failover state; if the modem is on a different slot than recorded (e.g. someone swapped it manually, or a reboot landed elsewhere), it **discards the stale file** rather than carry a lie forward.

---

## CGI contract — `/cgi-bin/quecmanager/monitoring/watchdog.sh`

### `GET` — settings + live status

Returns the saved config plus a snapshot of daemon/failover/swap state:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "settings": {
    "enabled": false,
    "fail_threshold": 5,
    "probe_interval": 5,
    "check_interval": 10,
    "cooldown": 60,
    "tier1_enabled": true,
    "tier2_enabled": true,
    "tier3_enabled": false,
    "tier4_enabled": true,
    "backup_sim_slot": null,
    "max_reboots_per_hour": 3
  },
  "status": { /* contents of /tmp/qmanager_watchcat.json, or {} if absent */ },
  "sim_failover": { /* contents of the failover record, or {"active":false} */ },
  "sim_swap": { /* SIM-swap detection, or {"detected":false} */ },
  "auto_disabled": false
}
```

### `POST` — dispatched on `action`

**`action: "save_settings"`** — carries every settings field in one atomic write. Validation is **two-pass**:

1. **Pass 1 (validate):** every field is extracted and range-checked *before any write*. The first invalid field short-circuits with, and nothing is persisted:

   ```json
   { "success": false, "error": "invalid_field", "field": "cooldown", "reason": "must be an integer between 10 and 300" }

2. **Pass 2 (apply):** only reached when every field validated. First runs the defensive `migrate_fail_threshold()` (in case this device hasn't been touched by the installer migration yet), then writes each key via `qm_config_set`, touches the reload flag, and toggles the service — enable+restart when `enabled=1` (also clearing `auto_disabled`), or stop+disable when `enabled=0`. When `probe_interval` is present it additionally propagates the value into `ping_profile.json.interval_sec` and touches `/tmp/qmanager_ping_reload` (see below).

   ```json
   { "success": true }
   ```

> ℹ️ NOTE — why two passes: `qm_config_set` writes each key immediately with no commit-staging (no transaction). Validating everything up front is the only way to guarantee a bad request can't leave the config half-applied. Tier enable booleans are the one exception — anything other than literal `true`/`false` is silently ignored (legacy parity), not rejected.

> ℹ️ NOTE — `migrate_fail_threshold()` also runs on **GET**, so a device that reads its settings before ever saving still gets `max_failures` transparently renamed to `fail_threshold`.

**Field ranges** (Pass 1): `fail_threshold` 1–20, `probe_interval` 1–60, `check_interval` 5–60, `cooldown` 10–300, `max_reboots_per_hour` 1–10, `backup_sim_slot` `1`/`2`/`null`.

**`probe_interval` propagation (Watchdog is the sole writer):** on save, `watchdog.sh` writes `watchcat.probe_interval` to `qmanager.conf` *and* merges it into `/etc/qmanager/ping_profile.json`'s `.interval_sec` via an atomic jq key-merge (`propagate_probe_interval`), then touches **both** reload flags — `/tmp/qmanager_ping_reload` (ping daemon re-reads cadence) and `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat_reload` (watchdog re-reads config). The merge only sets `.interval_sec`, so it never clobbers the `profile`/`target_ipv4`/`target_ipv6` keys owned by the Connection Quality "Probe Targets" card. Propagation is best-effort: the `watchcat.probe_interval` write always lands, and a failed merge is logged and skipped rather than failing the save.

**`action: "dismiss_sim_swap"`** — marks the physical-SIM-swap notification dismissed. → `{ "success": true }`

**`action: "revert_sim"`** — touches `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat_revert_sim`; the daemon reverts to the original slot on its next cycle. → `{ "success": true, "message": "SIM revert requested. The watchcat will process this shortly." }`

## Frontend anatomy

Page: `/monitoring/watchdog` — `components/monitoring/watchdog/watchdog.tsx`. A **status-first, two-column** layout (single column on narrow viewports): live status reads down the left, the one write surface (settings) holds the right.

**Data sources (three hooks):**
- `useWatchdogSettings` (`hooks/use-watchdog-settings.ts`) — the CGI above. Owns settings, `auto_disabled`, and the `save`/`revert_sim`/`dismiss_sim_swap` actions. Polls every 30s (silent) so `auto_disabled` surfaces live without flashing the skeleton.
- `useModemStatus` — the poller's `/tmp/qmanager_status.json` (`watchcat` + `sim_failover` blocks), polled every 5s. Feeds the **live** hero (state tile, counter strip, ladder highlight, failover banner).
- `useRecentActivities` — the shared Network Events feed, filtered client-side to `watchcat_recovery` + `sim_failover`. The watchdog writes its lifecycle to that feed using existing event types — no new event types were added.

**Left column:**
- **Watchdog Status** (`watchdog-status-card.tsx`) — a read-only Live Status hero: a `StateTile` (Monitoring / Detecting Issue / Recovering / Cooldown / Locked / Disabled), a wrap-flow counter strip (Current Step, Failed Checks, Cooldown remaining, Total Recoveries, Reboots This Hour, Last Recovery), a read-only `HeroLadder` stepper highlighting the running tier, an auto-disabled alert, and — when a failover is active — a "Running on backup SIM" alert with a **Revert to Original SIM** confirm dialog. The master enable **Switch** lives in this card's header and is *save-gated* (it applies on Save, not on toggle); the hero itself reflects **saved** state, never form drafts.
- **Recovery Activity** (`watchdog-recovery-activity-card.tsx`) — a paginated table of recent `watchcat_recovery` + `sim_failover` events.

**Right column:**
- **Watchdog Settings** (`watchdog-settings-card.tsx`) — tabbed **Detection** (**probe interval**, **failure threshold**, cooldown, plus a live "declares down after ~Ns" derivation computed as `probeInterval × failThreshold`) and **Recovery** (the four-rung ladder with per-tier switches, each showing its AT sequence; the backup-slot selector under Tier 3 and the reboot cap under Tier 4). One sticky save bar commits the whole form (the backend save is atomic). Each tab shows an error dot when a field on it is invalid, and a blocked save jumps to the first offending field. `check_interval` is no longer a user-facing field — the form carries it through read-only (`use-watchdog-form.ts`) so it round-trips unchanged.

**Backup-slot save gating:** enabling Tier 3 without choosing a backup slot **blocks the save** in the form (`use-watchdog-form.ts`) — the frontend guard that keeps you out of the misconfig-stops-ladder state described above. The form validation mirrors the CGI ranges exactly.

**Form re-seeding vs. the 30s poll:** `use-watchdog-form.ts` seeds its fields from `settings` and re-seeds **in place** when a *value fingerprint* of `settings` changes (`settingsSignature`, a render-phase sync that reuses the hook's own `discard()`). The fingerprint — not an object-identity check — is required here: `use-watchdog-settings.ts:114` does `setSettings({ ...json.settings, … })`, so the silent 30s refetch allocates a **fresh object every tick** even when nothing moved, and an identity comparison would wipe in-progress edits twice a minute. The page previously forced the same re-seed by keying `WatchdogForm` on that signature; that remount also destroyed the "Saved!" flash, the active Detection/Recovery tab, and the Recovery Activity table's pagination on every save. The key is gone (`watchdog.tsx` renders the form unkeyed) and any comment claiming the keying is intentional is stale. See [dashboard-state-motion.md](dashboard-state-motion.md) > Part 3.

> ℹ️ NOTE: The 30s poll can still re-seed the form mid-edit if the *server values genuinely change* (e.g. the daemon auto-disables itself). That was equally true under the old key, so it is not a regression — but a narrower sync that only refreshes fields the user has not touched is now possible, where a remount made it unreachable.

## Ping source / split ownership

The connectivity verdict the watchdog reads is produced by the **`qmanager_ping` daemon** — a small always-on producer that (as of v0.1.32) issues plain **ICMP `ping`** probes (IPv4-first, IPv6-fallback) and writes its verdict — including the raw `streak_fail` count — to `/tmp/qmanager_ping.json`. It runs independently of the watchdog: **the daemon stays up regardless of `watchcat.enabled`**, so the Connection Quality page and the poller still get a live verdict even when the watchdog itself is off. The watchdog only ever *reads* that file — it never probes and never writes it.

> ℹ️ NOTE — the watchdog's input did **not** change with the ICMP port. The recovery ladder keys off `streak_fail`, which the new shell ICMP producer emits exactly as the old Rust HTTP/204 producer did. What the watchdog lost is the `connectivity=limited` short-circuit (see the [inert-short-circuit note](#carrier-intercept-short-circuit-now-inert)) — a producer field that no longer exists. Full producer details: [connection-quality.md → The producer](connection-quality.md#the-producer--qmanager_ping-shell-icmp-daemon).

The daemon's own config lives in `/etc/qmanager/ping_profile.json`, and that one file has **two independent writers** (each an atomic key-merge, never a whole-file overwrite):

| Owner | CGI | Keys it writes | Reload flag it touches |
|-------|-----|----------------|------------------------|
| **Connection Watchdog** (Detection tab) | `monitoring/watchdog.sh` | `interval_sec` (from `watchcat.probe_interval`) | `/tmp/qmanager_ping_reload` **and** `/tmp/qmanager_watchcat_reload` |
| **Connection Quality** ("Probe Targets" card) | `settings/ping_profile.sh` | `profile`, `target_ipv4`, `target_ipv6` | `/tmp/qmanager_ping_reload` |

Because each writer merges only its own keys, the two never clobber each other. This is the split-ownership realignment: **the Watchdog owns the *cadence* (probe interval + fail threshold), the Connection Quality page owns the *targets*** — now IPv4/IPv6 ICMP hosts rather than the retired HTTP `target_1`/`target_2` URLs. One documented side effect: since `ping_profile.sh` merges only its own keys, changing `profile` no longer resets the daemon's per-field `interval_sec`/`fail_secs`/`recover_secs`/`history_secs` overrides — once present, those pass through unchanged. `profile` is now effectively a label paired with the targets.

> ℹ️ NOTE: The Quality Thresholds card (latency/loss presets feeding `events.sh` alerts) is a **separate** surface and was not touched by this rework.

## Known limitations

- **`qm_config_set` doesn't gate its `mv` on jq's exit status** (pre-existing). The `>` redirect creates an empty temp file *before* jq runs, so if jq fails on a corrupt/unparseable config, the unconditional `mv` publishes that empty temp over the live config. The `qm_config_delete` primitive added in this change was hardened against exactly this (it gates the `mv` on jq success); `qm_config_set` was left as-is and remains a latent hazard for a future fix.
