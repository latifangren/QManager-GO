# Data Counter Platform Matrix

> Cross-platform investigation of how Quectel 5G modems expose cellular byte counters. Companion to [`data-usage-counter.md`](./data-usage-counter.md) (which documents the current Schema v5 implementation).
>
> **Status:** Investigation phase complete for RM502Q-AE (SDX55) and RM520N-GL (SDX65). Findings differ enough between SoCs that a per-firmware lookup table is required if AT counters are ever brought back into the design.

## TL;DR

Both probed Quectel 5G modems show **the kernel `rmnet_ipa0` counter is accurate cumulatively** — the existing kernel-sourced design is mechanically correct on both platforms for lifetime/cumulative accounting. The "kernel under-reports because IPA bypasses it" theory is disproven for cumulative totals, but with a critical scope caveat: see [What this debunks](#what-this-debunks) and [Why Live Traffic was removed](#why-live-traffic-was-removed) below. IPA fast-path forwarded traffic is invisible to per-second reads even though it accumulates correctly over time.

However, the two SoCs disagree on **AT counter semantics** in ways that would break any naive "use AT counter for cumulative" alternative:

| Question | SDX55 (RM502Q-AE) | SDX65/SDX6X (RM520N-GL) |
|---|---|---|
| Are `QGDCNT` and `QGDNRCNT` independent? | **Yes** — QGDCNT=0 in SA mode | **No — they mirror each other** |
| `QGDNRCNT` field order | `<RX>,<TX>` (opposite of docs) | `<TX>,<RX>` (matches docs) |
| `Branch Name` string in `/etc/quectel-project-version` | `SDX55` | `SDX6X` |

Practical consequence: **the earlier recommendation to "always sum `QGDCNT + QGDNRCNT`" is wrong on SDX65** — it would double-count every byte. AT-based cumulative counters need a per-firmware behavior table, not a one-size-fits-all formula.

---

## The two counters in play

| Counter | Source | Time scope | Survives modem reboot? | Updates on what cadence? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kernel netdev (`/proc/net/dev`, `/sys/class/net/.../statistics/`) | Linux netdev stack, fed by the IPA driver | Per-boot (zeros on interface re-creation) | **No** | Per-second (sub-second on busy flows) |
| AT command (`AT+QGDCNT`, `AT+QGDNRCNT`) | Modem firmware internal | Lifetime (until explicit `=0` reset) | **Yes** | Updates as PS data flows; query whenever |

Neither is universally "right":
- **Cumulative "data used since user reset"** → AT counter is more resilient (no rebase losses when the modem reboots or the rmnet interface flaps), *but* per-firmware quirks mean you can't write portable AT-counter code without a lookup table.
- **Live throughput (bytes/sec)** → kernel counter is the cheap, latency-free choice. Confirmed portable across SDX55 and SDX65.
- **Cross-mode portability** (LTE / NSA / SA) → on SDX55, sum the two AT counters; on SDX65, they're aliases — read either one. Different mental model per platform.

---

## Kernel netdev counter (`rmnet_ipa0`)

On both probed devices, the cellular data plane terminates at the `rmnet_ipa0` netdev. Underneath sit `rmnet_data0..N` — L3-demultiplexed children, one per active PDN context. The `@rmnet_ipa0` notation in `ip link show` exposes the parent/child relationship:

```text
14: rmnet_data0@rmnet_ipa0: <UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc htb ...
```

**For aggregate WAN accounting, read `rmnet_ipa0`** — not the per-PDN children. The children only count IP-layer payload for one specific PDN; `rmnet_ipa0` is the sum across all PDNs plus signaling/control bytes.

The counter file format is the standard kernel one:
- `/proc/net/dev` columns: after `iface:`, field 2 = `rx_bytes`, field 10 = `tx_bytes`
- `/sys/class/net/$IFACE/statistics/rx_bytes` and `.../tx_bytes` — same numbers, individual files, no field counting needed

**Critical behaviors (confirmed identical on SDX55 and SDX65):**
- **Zeros on interface re-creation** — modem reboot, PDN re-establishment, `cfun=0/1` cycle, mode switch can all destroy and recreate the netdev. The accumulator in `qmanager_poller` handles this via negative-delta rebase logic (`qmanager_poller:728-734`), but bytes that flowed between the last sample and the reset are **lost** — the rebase counts forward from zero, not backward from the missing delta.
- **Real-time updates** — no batching observed on either firmware. Per-second deltas are honest.
- **The IPA hardware path does NOT bypass it** — controlled tests on both devices show full capture of 50 MiB downloads.

### Sub-interface inventory differs slightly

| Sub-interfaces present | SDX55 | SDX65 |
|---|---|---|
| `rmnet_data0` | yes | yes |
| `rmnet_data1..5` | yes | yes (down) |
| `rmnet_data15`, `rmnet_data16` | no | yes (down) |

The extra slots on SDX65 are likely reserved for MHI (Modem Host Interface) channels or additional PDN contexts. They were `state DOWN` in our probe — no impact on the aggregate counter.

---

## AT data counters (`QGDCNT`, `QGDNRCNT`)

These live in modem firmware, surviving every Linux-side event short of an explicit `AT+QGDCNT=0` / `AT+QGDNRCNT=0` reset.

| Command | Counts | Reset method | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AT+QGDCNT?` | LTE PS bearer bytes (per spec) | `AT+QGDCNT=0` | `+QGDCNT: <field1>,<field2>` |
| `AT+QGDNRCNT?` | NR (5G) bearer bytes (per spec) | `AT+QGDNRCNT=0` | `+QGDNRCNT: <field1>,<field2>` |

**Per spec they should be independent and RAT-scoped.** Empirically, this is true on SDX55 but **not** on SDX65 firmware `_A0.303`, where both AT commands return identical values regardless of which RAT carried the bytes.

### Per-firmware field order

| Firmware | `QGDNRCNT` field order | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| `RM502QAEAAR13A04M4G_01.200` (SDX55) | `<RX>,<TX>` | Observed: 18:1 ratio with field1=large value (downloads dominate) |
| `RM520NGLAAR03A03M4G_A0.303` (SDX65) | `<TX>,<RX>` | Observed: field1 grew by 6.16 MB during 5 MiB upload, field2 grew by 54.7 MB during 50 MiB download |

Quectel public documentation generally claims `<TX>,<RX>`. **SDX65 matches the docs; SDX55 does not.** Any AT-counter code must either:
- Carry a per-firmware lookup table, or
- Auto-detect orientation at runtime via known-direction probe traffic (more code, network cost)

### QGDCNT/QGDNRCNT independence

| Firmware | `QGDCNT` and `QGDNRCNT` independent? | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| `RM502QAEAAR13A04M4G_01.200` (SDX55) | **Yes.** In SA n41 mode, `QGDCNT: 0,0` while `QGDNRCNT` carried 36.4 GB | Sum is correct: `total = QGDCNT + QGDNRCNT` |
| `RM520NGLAAR03A03M4G_A0.303` (SDX65) | **No.** Both return identical bytes regardless of mode (verified during pure LTE traffic; both showed `54951394` for the same payload). | **Sum would double-count.** Read either one. |

This is the most surprising finding of the investigation. It means there is no portable "always sum both AT counters" formula — every firmware revision needs a behavior fingerprint before its counters can be trusted in code.

---

## Mode-dependent AT counter activity (with per-firmware caveat)

On firmwares where `QGDCNT` and `QGDNRCNT` are independent (like SDX55), the two AT counters are **RAT-scoped, not mode-scoped**. They populate based on which radio access technology actually carried the bytes:

| Current mode | `QGDCNT` (LTE) | `QGDNRCNT` (NR) | Truth on independent-counter firmware (SDX55) |
|---|---|---|---|
| LTE-only (no 5G) | active | 0 | `QGDCNT` alone |
| NSA EN-DC (LTE anchor + NR add-on) | active (LTE leg) | active (NR leg) | `QGDCNT + QGDNRCNT` |
| SA 5G (NR only) | 0 | active | `QGDNRCNT` alone |

On mirrored-counter firmware (like SDX65 `_A0.303`), the table collapses: **either counter shows the total**, regardless of mode. Summing would double-count.

Evidence from the SDX55 probe (camped on T-Mobile n41 SA):
```text
+QNWINFO: "TDD NR5G","310260","NR5G BAND 41",520110   # SA confirmed
+QGDCNT:   0,0                                         # LTE leg untouched
+QGDNRCNT: 36418574616, 2002334752                     # all bytes here (field1=RX)
```

Evidence from the SDX65 probe (camped on FDD LTE B3 + B28 CA, no 5G):
```text
+QNWINFO:   "FDD LTE","51503","LTE BAND 3",1350
+QGDCNT:    771352,54951394                            # field1=TX, field2=RX
+QGDNRCNT:  771352,54951394                            # IDENTICAL to QGDCNT — mirror behavior
```

Note how the SDX65 device is in **pure LTE** mode and `QGDNRCNT` still mirrors `QGDCNT`. Per spec, `QGDNRCNT` should be `0,0` since no NR traffic exists — but on this firmware, the spec is not what's implemented.

## What this debunks

Several plausible-sounding hypotheses turned out to be false:

| Hypothesis | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| IPA hardware path bypasses `/proc/net/dev` on SDX55 — for **on-modem-originated traffic** | ❌ False | Controlled 50 MiB download grew rx_bytes by 55.6 MB on SDX55, 54.9 MB on SDX65 |
| IPA hardware path bypasses `/proc/net/dev` — for **forwarded LAN→WAN fast-path traffic** | ⚠️ **True for per-tick reads, false for cumulative** | The original probes only tested on-modem `curl` (slow path). LAN-client traffic that takes the IPA fast path is forwarded in silicon and is invisible to per-second `/proc/net/dev` deltas — but it does accumulate via IPA notifications, so lifetime totals stay accurate. See [Why Live Traffic was removed](#why-live-traffic-was-removed). |
| Kernel rx/tx labels are reversed on SDX55 firmware | ⚠️ **UNRESOLVED — do not read this row as settled** | The slow-path test on SDX55 showed **correct** labels (see the matrix row above). The claim that some SDX55 IPA builds attribute *fast-path* bytes to the swapped column has **no recorded probe** in this file. Schema v4 ran a per-boot probe; Schema v5 replaced it with a static SoC-keyed map whose SDX55 arm is **inert** for exactly this reason. Phase B owns the measurement. See [Static SoC orientation mapping](#static-soc-orientation-mapping). |
| IPA batches updates and only flushes during sustained flows | ❌ False | 60-second per-second sampling on both devices showed continuous tiny deltas during idle keepalive |
| `QGDNRCNT` field order matches Quectel docs (`TX,RX`) on all firmware | ❌ False | SDX55 firmware reverses it; SDX65 matches docs. Per-firmware lookup is mandatory. |
| "Always sum `QGDCNT + QGDNRCNT`" is a portable formula | ❌ False | Works on SDX55 (independent counters). Double-counts on SDX65 (mirrored counters). |

## What's confirmed

1. **`rmnet_ipa0` is the correct aggregate WAN counter** on Quectel internal-Linux builds across both SoC generations. The `rmnet_dataN` children are per-PDN demuxed views that should not be used for whole-WAN totals.
2. **Kernel rx/tx labels match user-facing semantics for slow-path traffic on both probed firmwares.** Field 2 = download, field 10 = upload — verified on every on-modem probe. **Fast-path orientation has never been directly measured on either SoC.** The static SoC map exists to carry that decision (see [Static SoC orientation mapping](#static-soc-orientation-mapping)), but its only non-`normal` arm is inert pending a Phase-B measurement, so in practice every shipped device runs `normal` today. Schema v4's per-boot probe was removed because it misclassified real RM520N-GL devices under live traffic, not because the map was better evidenced.
3. **Per-second live updates work on both SoCs — for on-modem-originated traffic only.** Forwarded LAN→WAN fast-path traffic does not show up in per-tick `/proc/net/dev` deltas on either SoC. See [Why Live Traffic was removed](#why-live-traffic-was-removed).
4. **The kernel-only cumulative approach is mechanically sound** on the probed devices. The known weakness (counter zeroing on interface re-creation) is unchanged, but is not a per-SoC issue.
5. **The kernel counter and AT counter agree closely on SDX65** when measured over the same window (~322 KB drift over ~55 MB, attributable to signaling/control bytes that rmnet_ipa0 sees but the PS-data AT counter doesn't).

### Scoping caveat

Conclusions 2 and 3 above were originally written off probes that exercised only **on-modem-originated** traffic (`curl` running on the modem itself). On-modem traffic always traverses the kernel slow path, so it was always going to be visible to `/proc/net/dev`. The probes did not exercise **forwarded LAN→WAN traffic**, which is the dominant case in production deployments and is where the IPA fast path actually kicks in. The corrections in [What this debunks](#what-this-debunks) and the two new sections below carry the load of that updated understanding.

---

## Why Live Traffic was removed

The `qmanager_traffic` daemon (1 Hz `/proc/net/dev` reader, separate systemd unit, consumed by a `useTrafficStream` hook on the Device Metrics card) was removed in mid-2026.

**Root cause:** Quectel modems route LAN-to-WAN traffic through an IPA (IP Accelerator) hardware fast path. Once a flow is offloaded, the kernel netdev driver receives **accumulated** byte updates from IPA but does not see them per-packet. Concretely:

- Lifetime totals on `rmnet_ipa0` stay correct because IPA periodically flushes counters into the netdev stats.
- Per-tick deltas (the difference between two `/proc/net/dev` reads taken a second apart) are systematically missing the fast-path bytes between flushes.

The daemon could only see traffic originated **on** the modem — on-device speedtest runs, the modem's own background HTTP fetches, etc. It was structurally blind to actual user traffic from LAN clients, which is the only traffic anyone cares about watching live. Empirical confirmation on both RM502Q-AE (SDX55) and RM520N-GL (SDX65).

The Data Used cumulative counter (sourced from the same fields, sampled at the poller's 2 s Tier 1 cadence) is unaffected — cumulative reads catch the IPA flushes; per-second deltas don't. The per-second daemon added complexity, a parallel data path, and a permanent ~14 MB RSS daemon without delivering accuracy for the dominant traffic case.

---

## Static SoC orientation mapping

Schema v5 of the Data Used counter (see [`data-usage-counter.md`](./data-usage-counter.md)) maps the SoC's `Branch Name` from `/etc/quectel-project-version` directly to a `/proc/net/dev` field orientation:

- `SDX6X` → `normal` (field 2 = RX, field 10 = TX) — matches Quectel spec
- `SDX55` → `reversed` (field 2 = TX, field 10 = RX) — **NOT ACTIVE. See the warning below.**
- anything else / missing → `normal` (safe default)

This replaces the per-boot Cloudflare probe shipped in v4. The probe was observed misclassifying real RM520N-GL devices under live traffic — concurrent background flows, asymmetric signaling, and IPA flush timing could push the field-delta ratio outside the 5:1 classification threshold and produce a reversed verdict on a normal device. The static map eliminates that class of error.

> The [What this debunks](#what-this-debunks) table offers a reconciliation — that the measured `Normal` reading came from a **slow-path** test (on-modem `curl`) while the reversal is claimed only for **IPA fast-path** bytes. That reconciliation is plausible and may well be right, but it is **not itself backed by a recorded probe** anywhere in this file or in the plan that introduced the map ([`2026-05-24-static-soc-counter-orientation.md`](../superpowers/plans/2026-05-24-static-soc-counter-orientation.md), which cites *this document* as its evidence).

> **What is shipped today (Phase A, T4, 2026-08-26):** every SoC resolves to `normal`. The `SDX55` arm exists as a commented-out `case` line in `detect_orientation_from_soc()` and is pinned inert by a behavioural assertion in `scripts/test/poller-data-used.sh`. This became urgent because until T4 the poller's SoC parser never matched any real device (it grepped `^Branch Name` with one space; the vendor file column-aligns with two), so the map had *never* been live in the field. Repairing the parser would have activated an unmeasured map for the first time, on fielded RM502Q-AE / RG502Q community devices.
>
> **Phase B owns measuring this** — a controlled *forwarded LAN→WAN* transfer on a real SDX55, not another on-modem `curl`. Until that measurement exists, do not activate the arm and do not present the reversal as a fact.

If a new SoC ships and turns out to disagree with the table, update the map in `scripts/usr/bin/qmanager_poller`'s `detect_orientation_from_soc()` — there is no runtime override. Note that function no longer parses `/etc/quectel-project-version` itself: since T4 it delegates the SoC read to **`qm_hw_soc()` in `scripts/usr/lib/qmanager/hw_profile.sh`**, whose matcher tolerates the vendor file's variable whitespace. A parser change belongs there; only the `case` arms belong in the poller.

## Implications for QManager schema design

The current Schema v3 design (kernel-only, no AT counter) is appropriate for **both live throughput and cumulative**, with one known weakness:

- **Cumulative loss on interface re-creation** — every rmnet counter zeroing event silently loses the bytes that flowed since the last 2-second Tier 1 tick. The poller marks these via `modem_reset_count` but doesn't recover the in-flight bytes.

A hybrid design that addresses this weakness would need to handle the per-firmware AT counter quirks documented above. Sketch:

| Concern | Approach |
|---|---|
| Live rate | Keep reading rmnet (cheap, fast, portable) |
| Cumulative total | Per-firmware AT counter strategy: SDX55 sums independent counters with `<RX>,<TX>` orientation; SDX65 reads either counter with `<TX>,<RX>` orientation; unknown firmware falls back to rmnet |
| User-triggered reset | Issue both `AT+QGDCNT=0` and `AT+QGDNRCNT=0` to keep them synchronized; rebase rmnet to current value |
| Per-firmware lookup key | Match on `Project Rev` (e.g. `RM502QAEAAR13A04M4G_01.200`), not just Branch Name — different firmware revisions of the same SoC may behave differently |

**This is not a recommendation to change Schema v3 today** — it's the design space the investigation maps out. A real fix should follow the standard Change Workflow (Phase 2 plan, approval gate, etc.).

## Open questions

1. **Is the SDX65 "mirror" behavior consistent across all `RM520NGL...` firmware revisions, or specific to `_A0.303`?** Earlier revisions might have independent counters; later ones might too. We've only probed one firmware per SoC.
2. **What zeroing events does rmnet_ipa0 experience in practice on each platform?** Needs longer-running logging on a device with frequent radio events. Candidates: handover, attach/re-attach, PDN re-establish, `cfun` cycle, IPv6 RA refresh.
3. **The user's "broken" RM502Q-AE report doesn't match the patterns this investigation reveals.** Their device showed ~12 MB / 4 MB accumulated when they believed they'd moved 2 GB / 150 MB. Both probed devices show orientation is correct and IPA captures everything. Hypotheses for the user's device:
   - Different firmware revision with a real driver bug
   - Frequent PDN re-establishment causing repeated rebase losses
   - Misidentified device (not actually RM502Q-AE)
   - Different bug entirely; the "reversed" perception was pattern-matched to swap labels because the absolute numbers were wrong

   **A follow-up controlled-download test on the user's actual device is the only way to settle which.**
4. **How does SDX65 firmware `_A0.303` populate AT counters under actual NR/NSA traffic?** Our SDX65 probe was on LTE-only, so we couldn't verify whether the mirror behavior holds in NSA EN-DC or SA. Needs re-probing when the test device can be steered onto 5G.

## Probe methodology (reproducible)

A self-contained read-only probe lives at `scratch/rm520_probe.sh`. Key sections:

1. Identity & SoC (uname, project-version, IPA modules)
2. Interface inventory (all `rmnet*`, `wwan*`, `ecm*`)
3. Initial counter snapshot (sysfs + `/proc/net/dev`)
4. AT counter cross-check (`QGDCNT?`, `QGDNRCNT?`, `QNWINFO`, `QCAINFO`)
5. **Controlled orientation test** — 50 MiB Cloudflare download + 5 MiB upload; reveals true orientation
6. 60-second per-second live sampling — reveals flush cadence
7. Post-test AT counter snapshot — cross-validates against rmnet delta
8. IPA driver introspection (`/sys/module/ipa*`, `/sys/kernel/debug/ipa`)

Network cost: ~55 MB per run. Read-only — no AT writes, no service touches.

**Probe artifacts (gitignored):**
- `scratch/rm520_probe.sh` — the probe script
- `scratch/rm520_probe.log` — most recent RM520N-GL run output

Add new firmware revisions to this matrix by running the probe and updating both the SoC × counter table and the field-order / independence tables above.
