// =============================================================================
// Dashboard — shared geometry contract
// =============================================================================
// The `/dashboard` family's FIRST shapes module, and it is the pre-step of the
// design-language adoption pass for a reason: every later step imports from
// here, so no step after this one has anywhere to restate a number.
//
// The dashboard has essentially no TOKEN drift — DESIGN.md was written FROM
// this surface. All of its drift is GRAMMAR: one card shell spelled out three
// times in three files, one row pill spelled two ways, a clock interval
// declared twice, and a tile geometry the rest of the product hoisted into a
// shared module years of surfaces ago. Every one of those is a place two
// authors can disagree without either of them being wrong, which is exactly
// what a shapes module removes.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE TILE GEOMETRY IS RESTATED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `components/cellular/tile-shape.ts` holds the identical tile box, and this
// file deliberately does NOT import it. `/dashboard` is a separate route family
// and must not reach into `components/cellular/`; the ethernet, custom-dns,
// ttl-mtu, ip-passthrough and traffic-engine modules all restate their geometry
// from each other for the same reason. What is shared is the SYSTEM's numbers,
// not a module. The values below are the system's, verbatim:
//
//   104px pinned tile   28px radius   52px disc   36px card   40px row
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THREE DIVERGENCES THIS MODULE RECORDS RATHER THAN SILENTLY NORMALISES
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Each belongs to a later step of the pass. Writing them down here is what
// stops the next reader re-deriving them from scratch — and, more usefully,
// stops them "fixing" one in isolation and finding out afterwards that the
// skeleton beside it was mirroring the old number.
//
//   1. `device-status.tsx` wrote the row pill with `px-[15px]` where the other
//      two sites use `px-4` (16px). `ROW` standardises on `px-4`, and step 03
//      re-pointed device-status onto it. RESOLVED — one spelling remains.
//
//   2. `signal-history.tsx` is a grid PEER (`rounded-card`) but padded `px-7`,
//      which is the HERO padding, with a comment defending the mock's 28px.
//      The pass resolves that in favour of `px-6` so the card matches its
//      row-mates; step 08 owns the re-point, not this step.
//
//   3. `TILE` is minted at the system's 104px pinned geometry. Step 03 gave it
//      its first consumer: device-status's uptime pair, which shipped as
//      bespoke 62px blocks with a floating height. RESOLVED.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// GEOMETRY ONLY — NO JSX
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is a `.ts` file, like all thirteen of its siblings. Components that need
// a home of their own get one: `PillRow` lives in `./pill-row.tsx` and consumes
// `ROW` from here.

/**
 * The three hero orbs — one geometry, two sizes, ONE ratio.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS A PROPERTY AND NOT TWO SETS OF NUMBERS
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The service orb is four concentric absolutely-positioned discs — an outer
 * ring, two inner rings and a core — and their sizes only mean anything
 * RELATIVE to each other. Shipped, they were 152 / 112 / 80 / 48, which is
 * 1 : 0.7368 : 0.5263 : 0.3158.
 *
 * Adding a second size by re-typing four numbers is four chances to get one of
 * them wrong, and a wrong one fails nothing that would tell you: not the build,
 * not the typecheck, not a screenshot. It just makes the stack very slightly
 * not concentric, at one width, on one device class. So `--orb` carries the
 * size and every other dimension below is a `calc()` against it. There is one
 * number to change and the proportions cannot drift.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE COMPACT SIZE IS FLUID RATHER THAN A FLAT 92px
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Below the card query the orbs sit 3-across, and three 92px discs plus their
 * gaps do not fit a hero card on a 320px phone: the page gutter and the card's
 * own `px-7` leave ~232px of content there, against 3 × 92 + 2 × 12 = 300.
 * A flat 92 would overflow exactly the device class R3 exists for.
 *
 * `min(92px, 28cqw)` reads 92px wherever the card has ~329px of content and
 * degrades below it, so the cap is the design value and the query unit is only
 * the fallback — not the other way round. At the narrowest realistic card it
 * resolves to ~65px against a 69px ceiling, which is the fit this ratio was
 * chosen to clear.
 *
 * ⚠️ `cqw` AND THE SIZE QUERY BOTH MEASURE THE CONTENT BOX, not the border box.
 * `HERO_SHELL` declares `@container/card` and carries `px-7`, so a 624px card
 * queries as 568. This was measured, not assumed, and it corrected this
 * module's first draft twice: the threshold below had been pushed one step up
 * on border-box arithmetic that said three full-size orbs would not fit a
 * 512px card. Against the content box they fit with 24px to spare, and the
 * step-up had simply stopped firing at widths where the full orbs belong.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PULSE SURVIVES THE SCALING FOR FREE
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `animate-pulse-ring` is a `scale(0.82) → scale(1)` keyframe. A transform
 * scale is proportional by construction, so it reads identically at 92px and at
 * 152px and needed no second tuning. Had it been written in px it would have.

 *
 * It is a shared SENTINEL rather than a spelling because separate places have
 * to AGREE about it, not merely match it by eye. `signal-rows.ts` emits it and
 * `signal-status-card.tsx` compares against it — a pill wrapping a placeholder
 * reads as a broken chip rather than as absent data, so the identity band falls
 * back to plain ink when it sees this string. A builder and a guard that
 * disagree about the placeholder ship exactly the broken chip the guard exists
 * to prevent, and nothing fails when they drift.
 *
 * Step 03 gave it a third consumer, which is what moved it here from
 * `signal-status-card.tsx`: a sentinel read by three files in two card families
 * is a property of the SURFACE, and a card is not the right home for one.
