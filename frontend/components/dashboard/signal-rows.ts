// =============================================================================
// The signal pair's row builder
// =============================================================================
// This replaces `nr-status.tsx` and `lte-status.tsx`, which were two components
// that rendered nothing. Each mapped one poller block to `SignalStatusRow[]`
// and forwarded the same six props to `SignalStatusCard`; the only differences
// were which block they read and which labels they used. A component whose
// entire body is "map this object to that prop bundle" is a function wearing a
// component's costume, and two of them side by side are two copies of one
// function.
//
// The line count is not the point. What the two copies were carrying:
//
//   · the three threshold sets, imported twice,
//   · the absent-value formatter, written twice,
//   · and — the reason this arrived in the same commit as the no-reading
//     state — a state that would otherwise have had to be authored twice and
//     kept in step by hand.
//
// THE TWO LEGS ARE NOT THE SAME LIST, so this branches on `family` rather than
// pretending they are and reading through an optional field. NR carries SCS and
// no RSSI; LTE carries RSSI and no SCS; and their channel numbers are different
// quantities with different names (ARFCN vs EARFCN), not one field spelled two
// ways. The measurement trio in the middle IS shared, and it is shared by
// construction here rather than by two authors happening to agree.
//
// ROW ORDER IS PART OF THE CONTRACT. `TickGroup` ranks the values that moved
// this poll by their live DOM position, and the card's row grid has no
// `grid-cols-*`, so document order IS reading order. Identity first, then the
// channel and cell identifiers, then the measurements. Do not reorder to make
// the two legs symmetrical — LTE's RSSI sits with the measurements because it
// is one, and NR's SCS sits last because it is an identifier.
// =============================================================================
