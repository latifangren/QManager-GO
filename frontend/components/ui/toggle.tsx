/**
 * The transition is written out longhand because it runs on TWO clocks, and no
 * single Tailwind duration utility can express that. This is the same recipe
 * `badge.tsx` uses, for the same reason and against the same property pair.
 *
 *   color       -> `standard` (600ms). The ink swap. Two of the four consumers
 *                  (segmented-field.tsx, signal-history.tsx) put a `layoutId`
 *                  thumb underneath it at `transitionStandard`, so matching that
 *                  clock is what makes the label finish changing colour as the
 *                  pill lands rather than while it is still moving.
 *   box-shadow  -> `quick` (360ms). This is the `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` ring,
 *                  a pointer/keyboard state. At the longer duration it lags
 *                  visibly while tabbing through a settings form — badge.tsx
 *                  documents the same finding.
 *
 * WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE, and why it was a bug: `transition-[color,box-shadow]`
 * with no `duration-*` and no `ease-*`. `app/globals.css` does not override
 * `--default-transition-duration`, so Tailwind's own 150ms default applied —
 * off the shipped 360/600/800 scale, and immune to a retune of `lib/motion.ts`
 * plus the `--duration-*` properties. That is DESIGN.md > The One-Scale Rule,
 * and it leaked into all four consumers at once because none of them overrides
 * this string.
 *
 * `background-color` is deliberately NOT in the list. It is live and still cuts
 * instantly on the two `variant="outline"` consumers (`hover:bg-accent`,
 * `data-[state=on]:bg-primary/10`) — badge.tsx calls the identical omission a
 * bug in its own case. Adding it here is a behaviour change rather than a leak
 * fix, so it was scoped out at the approval gate rather than smuggled in.
