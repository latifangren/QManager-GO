// =============================================================================
// Custom DNS — shared geometry and tone contract
// =============================================================================
// The `/local-network/custom-dns` family's shapes module, and the THIRD under
// `/local-network/`. `components/local-network/ethernet/shapes.ts` landed first
// and the DPI surface's landed second, so the convention here is inherited
// rather than invented.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE GEOMETRY IS RESTATED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `components/cellular/tile-shape.ts` holds the identical tile box and this file
// deliberately does NOT import it, and neither does it import either sibling
// module under `/local-network/`. Geometry is restated across sibling families;
// anything genuinely family-wide is promoted one level up instead. What is
// shared is the SYSTEM's numbers, not a module.
//
// The values below are the system's, verbatim:
//
//   104px pinned tile   28px radius   52px disc   42px control   36px card
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THIS FILE REPLACES
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The retired `custom-dns-card.tsx` had no shapes module at all, and the five
// defects that follow from that are all visible only across files:
//
//   * the card was the raw primitive — `card.tsx` ships `rounded-xl border
//     shadow-sm`, so a 12px radius, a hairline and a shadow outside the
//     vocabulary shipped on a system whose card role is 36px / border-0 /
//     `--shadow-whisper`.
//   * the loading skeleton promised `h-[68px]` and four `h-9` boxes. Not one of
//     those is a height this system ships, and none of them mirrored the loaded
//     form (a switch row, N 42px fields, a 42px button).
//   * the error band was `border-destructive/50 bg-destructive/10` — an alpha
//     wash on a role colour AND a hairline on a fill, both retired. An alpha is
//     a request to whatever happens to be behind it rather than to the token, so
//     it renders a different colour on a card than it does on a popover.
//   * the surface ran a private motion scale, `REVEAL_DURATION = 0.2` with an
//     out-quart curve. 200ms is on neither the 360/600/800 duration scale nor
//     either shipped ease, so a retune of the token layer could never reach it.
//   * nine sites reached for `text-muted-foreground`, which is not this system's
//     ink; `on-surface-variant` is.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CARD IS COMPOSED FROM `Card` / `CardHeader` / `CardTitle` /
// `CardDescription` / `CardContent`
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `Card` takes `CARD_SHELL`; `CardHeader` and `CardContent` each take
// `CARD_PAD`; `CardTitle` takes `CARD_TITLE`; `CardDescription` takes no
// className. This is the reference convention (speed-limit-card.tsx:134-139)
// and CLAUDE.md's stated rule: plain `CardTitle` + `CardDescription`, never an
// icon inside either.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// COLOUR: NEUTRAL BODIES, AND ONLY TWO DISCS MOVE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every tile body is `TILE.BODY` and there is no `tone` prop to override it.
// Colour lives on the 52px disc. Two discs pick a tone at runtime and they are
// the only two things on this strip with a functional state:
//
//   CARRIER FALLBACK  warning when the fallback is OFF. That is a real
//                     behavioural difference — a lookup fails outright instead
//                     of leaking to the carrier — and it is the one setting on
//                     this page whose "on" is quieter than its "off".
//   UPSTREAM 1 / 2    destructive when the sentinel block is malformed, because
//                     in that state the list being printed is not reliably what
//                     dnsmasq is resolving against.
//
// SOURCE is permanently neutral. "Custom" versus "Carrier" is a CATEGORY, not a
// verdict — neither is healthier than the other — and minting a hue for it is
// the failure the colour system exists to prevent (The Neutral-Default Rule).
