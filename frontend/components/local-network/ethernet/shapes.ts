// =============================================================================
// Ethernet Status — shared geometry and tone contract
// =============================================================================
// The `/local-network/ethernet` family's FIRST shapes module, and the reason it
// exists is finding 10 of the approved proposal: one caption role was spelled
// three ways (`CAPTION`, `CAPTION_CLASS`, plus a third literal at the call
// sites) because there was nowhere for it to live. Every consumer imports from
// here, INCLUDING the skeletons — a skeleton that restates a number has left
// the contract (The Skeleton-Mirror Rule).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE GEOMETRY IS RESTATED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `components/cellular/tile-shape.ts` holds the identical tile box, and this
// file deliberately does NOT import it. `/local-network/` is a separate route
// family and must not reach into `components/cellular/`; the sibling families
// under `/cellular/settings/` restate their geometry from each other for the
// same reason. What is shared is the SYSTEM's numbers, not a module.
//
// The values below are the system's, verbatim:
//
//   104px pinned tile   28px radius   52px disc   42px control   36px card
//
// The retired module got two of those wrong. It carried `min-h-[5.75rem]` on
// the tile root and `h-[5.75rem]` on the skeleton — the pre-correction 92px
// number, which is both the wrong MECHANISM (a floor cannot be a mirror; only a
// pin can) and 12px shorter than every other strip in the product.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TONE RULE ON THIS SURFACE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every tile body is `TILE.BODY`, and there is no `tone` prop to override it.
// The disc is the only coloured element, and only ONE disc changes tone at
// runtime — the link tile's, because the link is the only thing here with a
// functional state.
//
// Three of the four bodies used to be large tinted containers
// (`success-container`, `downlink-container`, `primary-container`), which is
// the composition `radio/summary-tiles.tsx` reached through five generations
// and deleted at Gen 5: its Gen 2 note measured that shape at 623x212 =
// 132,033px^2 carrying 7.2% ink and called it "a large empty purple slab". The
// four `opacity-85` ink washes went with the tints — they existed only to soften
// an `on-*-container` ink that no longer has a container to sit on, and once the
// body is neutral they resolve to a real `on-surface-variant`.
//
// The rate tile is the one worth naming. Its retired comment justified
// `downlink-container` as "Downlink Rose's second meaning", a rule DESIGN.md
// retired on 2026-08-16 ("the previous system gave rose a second meaning ('and
// capacity')... which made the axis untrue"). A negotiated Ethernet link rate is
// bidirectional and has no honest hue, so it is neutral — The Neutral-Default
// Rule, and the whole point of the system is that a plain-looking block is not
// a reason to mint a meaning for an existing colour.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RADIUS MAPPING FROM THE APPROVED COMP
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The comp is drawn in raw pixels; this surface ships the role scale, mapped by
// SHAPE ROLE rather than by nearest number:
//
//   comp 36px  card shell   -> `rounded-card` (36px)  — a PEER card, not a hero
//   comp 28px  tile, group  -> `rounded-tile` (28px)
//   comp 20px  row          -> `rounded-field` (20px)
//   comp 999px chips, discs -> `rounded-pill`
//
// `rounded-hero` is "the ONE card that anchors a surface". Both cards on this
// page wore it, alongside a `shadow-sm` that is outside the shadow vocabulary
// entirely. The anchor here is the strip; the cards are peers.

 * looks approximately right in dark mode, which is exactly why it survives
 * review.
 *
 * Writing the `dark:` half is necessary and not sufficient. Once both rules are
 * `dark:`-prefixed they TIE at (0,2,0), and a tie is decided by emission order —
 * Tailwind's deterministic candidate sort, i.e. by name. `bg-input…` sorts
 * before `bg-surface-…` only because *i* precedes *s*. That is an observed
 * outcome, not a constructed one, so the dark half carries the important
 * modifier and wins by construction instead of by alphabet.
