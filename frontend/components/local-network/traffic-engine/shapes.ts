// =============================================================================
// Traffic Engine — shared geometry and tone contract
// =============================================================================
// The `/local-network/traffic-engine` family's shapes module, and the SECOND
// under `/local-network/` — `components/local-network/ethernet/shapes.ts` landed
// one commit earlier, so the convention here is inherited rather than invented.
// (The approved proposal called this "the first shapes module outside
// components/cellular/". That was wrong, and it is corrected here rather than
// quietly: the decision is unaffected, only its novelty claim was.)
//
// Findings 03, 04, 07 and 08 of the proposal are all the failure this module
// prevents, and none of them is visible in any single file:
//
//   03  `MUTED_BADGE = "bg-muted/50 text-muted-foreground border-muted-foreground/30"`
//       hand-reimplemented `Badge variant="muted"` — while the sibling file in
//       the same folder used the variant correctly. One folder, two answers.
//   04  ...and that identical string was restated INLINE in a second file
//       rather than importing the constant, so the drift had already begun.
//   07  Four pseudo-tiles at `rounded-tile bg-surface-container p-4`, repeated
//       four times, with two different `gap` values and NO height pin.
//   08  The page skeleton restated `h-40` / `h-9` / `h-[22rem]` against a loaded
//       layout it had never measured, and the status card's own skeleton was
//       four bare `h-16` blocks against tiles that resolve far taller.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE GEOMETRY IS RESTATED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `components/cellular/tile-shape.ts` holds the identical tile box and this file
// deliberately does NOT import it. `/local-network/` is a separate route family
// and must not reach into `components/cellular/`; the sibling families under
// `/cellular/settings/` restate their geometry from each other for the same
// reason. What is shared is the SYSTEM's numbers, not a module.
//
// The values below are the system's, verbatim:
//
//   104px pinned tile   28px radius   52px disc   42px control   36px card
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THERE IS NO `min-h-` IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The tile is PINNED because a skeleton mirrors it, and a floor cannot be a
// mirror — a floored tile resolves to whatever its content needs and the
// skeleton->content handoff jumps by the difference. Every other box here sizes
// to its content through padding instead, so nothing in the family is floored:
// a mode hint and an idle explanation both wrap to two lines on a narrow
// container, where a fixed height would clip them and a floor would only look
// like a pin until it did not.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// COLOUR: NEUTRAL BODIES, AND ONLY TWO DISCS MOVE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every tile body is `TILE.BODY` and there is no `tone` prop to override it.
// Colour lives on the disc, and only the ENGINE and REDIRECT-RULE discs pick a
// tone at runtime, because they are the only two things on the strip with a
// functional state.
//
// PROCESSED AND SCOPE ARE NEUTRAL, WHICH DEPARTS FROM THE APPROVED COMP. The
// comp drew them on `downlink` and `spatial`. Both would mint a second meaning
// for an existing axis, which is the exact failure `globals.css` records having
// already removed once: "the previous system gave rose a second meaning ('and
// capacity') and cyan a second ('and counts'), which made the axis untrue — a
// carrier count wore upload cyan while reporting nothing about upload. A count
// is neutral." A packet counter is a count, and a domain count is a count.
// Spatial means "a figure naming both radios at once", which a hostlist size is
// not. So both take `DISC_NEUTRAL` under The Neutral-Default Rule, the same call
// the ethernet strip made for its negotiated rate one commit earlier. A colour
// that never changes encodes nothing anyway.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RADIUS MAPPING FROM THE APPROVED COMP
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The comp is drawn in raw pixels; this surface ships the role scale, mapped by
// SHAPE ROLE rather than by nearest number:
//
//   comp 36px  card shell        -> `rounded-card` (36px) — PEER cards
//   comp 40px  condition screen  -> `rounded-hero` (40px) — the anchor
//   comp 28px  tile              -> `rounded-tile` (28px)
//   comp 20px  field, banner     -> `rounded-field` (20px)
//   comp 999px rows, chips, disc -> `rounded-pill`
//
// The strip is the anchor on the installed page, so the cards below it are
// peers. On the NOT-INSTALLED page there is no strip, and the condition screen
// is the anchor — which is why it, and only it, wears `rounded-hero`.

/**
 * The two-up band: the mode decision beside the test that measures it.
 *
 * Requested directly, and it does change this page's documented cadence — the
 * shell used to read strip, decision, what the decision operates on, then the
 * occasional test. It now reads decision beside measurement, then the payload.
 * The shell's own header comment is rewritten to say so; a file that describes
 * an order it no longer has is worse than one that describes none.
 *
 * THE HEIGHT LOCK REPLACED AN `items-start`, AND THE EARLIER CALL IS RECORDED
 * RATHER THAN OVERWRITTEN. That version reasoned: DESIGN.md does not ban equal
 * heights, it makes them explicit and conditional on symmetry being a real
 * property of the pair, and it was not one, because the verify card was a
 * single footnote line when idle and a headline plus three bars when complete,
 * so a lock would strand dead space in whichever card had less to say.
 *
 * The reasoning held. The premise did not survive contact with the request.
 * The right answer to "make these the same height" is not to force a lock over
 * a card with nothing to fill it. That IS the Radio Information failure
 * DESIGN.md records paying for once, where a static reference card and a live
 * telemetry card were `h-full`-locked and ~200px of dead air moved between
 * them with the carrier count. The answer is to give the shorter card a
 * resting state designed to FILL (`RESTING` below), after which symmetry is a
 * real property of the pair and the lock states something true.
 *
 * So both halves are load-bearing and neither works alone: `items-stretch`
 * makes the CELL take the row's height, `*:data-[slot=card]:h-full` makes the
 * CARD fill that cell (a stretched cell holding a content-height card looks
 * exactly like no change at all), and both cards grow their `CardContent` so
 * the spare height reaches the content instead of pooling underneath it. This
 * is the spelling DESIGN.md > Layout names, and the one four `/cellular/`
 * surfaces already ship.
 *
 * WHY THE 5XL STEP AND NOT THE 6XL ONE. The container is the viewport less
 * 264px of sidebar, less 48px of main padding, less 16px of page padding. The
 * 6xl step (1152px) therefore needs a viewport past 1480px — a 1440px laptop,
 * the commonest desktop width there is, would never see this layout at all.
 * The 5xl step (1024px) needs 1352px, and its ~546px cells clear the 512px
 * threshold `CMP_ROW` uses to keep the comparison rows on one line. The cost
 * is a ~20px band of viewport widths where those rows take their already
 * designed wrapped layout, which is a layout and not a defect. The 5xl step is
 * also one this codebase already uses; the 6xl step appears nowhere in it.

/**
 * The resting state of a card that has nothing to report yet.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT IS `components/ui/empty.tsx`'s AND THE PRIMITIVE IS NOT USED, for
 * a measured reason rather than a preference. `Empty` ships
 * `p-6 ... md:p-12` — a VIEWPORT breakpoint — inside a family whose entire
 * responsive contract is container queries, and no call-site class can remove
 * it: `p-*` and `md:p-*` are different variants, so `cn()` keeps both and the
 * viewport one wins above 768px. The only escape is to restate a `md:` class of
 * your own, which is what the one in-repo consumer had to do
 * (`antenna-statistics/tech-card.tsx`, `py-10 md:py-10`).
 *
 * This family already made exactly this call once, one section down: `FIELD`
 * refuses the `Input` primitive because "the size reverts at a 768px VIEWPORT,
 * which is a viewport breakpoint leaking into a container-query surface".
 * `CONDITION` restates the shared condition screen for the same reason. So the
 * shape is restated here and the primitive stays unimported — the third
 * instance of one rule, not a new exception to it.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. A resting state that fills is the thing that makes
 * `CARD_PAIR`'s height lock honest instead of forced: `flex-1` on the block AND
 * on the `CardContent` that hosts it, so the spare height from the taller
 * sibling reaches the content rather than pooling under it. `Empty` itself
 * ships `flex-1 justify-center` and still failed at this in `tech-card.tsx`,
 * because a block-level `CardContent` gave the grow nothing to grow inside.
 * That note is why `CONTENT` exists here as its own export: the host has to be
 * a flex column too, and it is the half that gets forgotten.
 *
 * The disc is the family's own: 56px, full-round, one container step above the
 * card ground, per The Glyph-Disc Rule — not the primitive's `bg-muted`
 * `rounded-lg` square, whose radius is off the role scale entirely.
