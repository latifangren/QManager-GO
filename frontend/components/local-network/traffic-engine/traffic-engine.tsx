// =============================================================================
// TrafficEngine — the /local-network/traffic-engine page shell
// =============================================================================
// The page used to be organised around the CONFIG FILE: a status card, two tabs
// named after the two config keys, a test, a QUIC toggle. The user arrives with
// one question — "is my video throttled, and is the fix on?" — and a second one
// they ask once: "is it actually helping?"
//
// It is now a page header, a live tile strip, and a band of peer cards ordered
// by CADENCE: the live state, then the DECISION BESIDE THE MEASUREMENT THAT
// JUDGES IT, then what that decision operates on, then the independent QUIC
// control. QUIC is last because its independence from the engine is documented
// and deliberate (docs/reference/dpi.md > QUIC handling).
//
// That cadence changed on 2026-08-31 at direct user request, and it REORDERS
// what the paragraph above used to document. The retired order was a single
// column: mode, then targets, then the occasional test. The mode card and the
// verify card are now a two-up pair on the first row of one grid, with the
// targets card spanning both columns beneath them — because "which mode is on"
// and "is it actually helping" are the two halves of one question, and reading
// them a scroll apart was what made the test feel occasional.
//
// CSS `order` was considered and rejected. It could have kept the old
// single-column reading order under the new visual one, but that is precisely
// the disagreement between DOM order and visual order that WCAG 1.3.2
// (Meaningful Sequence) exists to forbid — a worse defect than the one it would
// paper over. The DOM order below IS the reading order, on every width.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE ANSWER TO "WHICH MODE IS ACTIVE", AND IT IS DERIVED HERE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the fix for the correctness bug. The shell used to hand the status
// card `videoOptimizer.data ?? fullBypass.data` and let the card work out its
// own shape from `"sni_domain" in data`. Both hooks fetch, so the Video
// Optimizer's payload essentially always won — and with FULL BYPASS enabled the
// card still rendered "Domains loaded", a figure for a mode that has no domain
// list.
//
// `mode` is now derived ONCE, from the two `enabled` flags, and passed down. No
// component below infers it, and no component sniffs a payload for its shape.
//
// The four LIVE fields are a separate question and are read differently: status,
// uptime, packet count and rule presence are ENGINE-GLOBAL — there is one tpws
// process and one REDIRECT rule, and both CGI sections report the same ones — so
// either section answers them identically and the shell simply takes whichever
// read succeeded. That was never the bug. The bug was using the same fallback to
// decide the MODE.
//
// The backend contract is untouched: same endpoint, same actions, same fields,
// same 2s cadence, same mutex enforced on the CGI side.
// =============================================================================

             roughly 800px of layout arriving after the fact, on a surface whose
             own module exists because a skeleton had already drifted from its
             content once (finding 08). The report was that it "doesnt really
             show the true content once loaded", which is precisely what a
             skeleton for one of four bands does.

             Each card's mirror lives BESIDE that card rather than here. A
             skeleton kept in the shell drifts the first time its card changes,

             card, the two are read together by anyone editing either. What the

             `CARD_PAIR` the loaded band uses -- so the column split, the gap
             and the height lock cannot disagree between the two states.

             `aria-hidden` on each mirror, and the whole thing is inert: the
             root already carries `aria-live="polite"`, so an announced skeleton
             would read its placeholder geometry aloud before the real content
