// =============================================================================
// VerifyCard — "Test bypass", drawn as a comparison rather than a list
// =============================================================================
// This is Call B, and it merges `engine-check-row.tsx` (the run/poll machinery)
// with `result-alert.tsx` (the result). The backend contract is untouched: the
// same `action=verify` POST, the same `action=verify_status` poll, the same
// 12-minute window — each phase can take two 3-minute speedtest attempts on a
// throttled link, and a tighter window reported false timeouts.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE RESULT IS A GRAPHIC NOW
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Finding 18, and it is the biggest unclaimed win on the surface. The whole
// feature exists to answer ONE question — "is the bypass actually helping?" —
// and the answer was three `justify-between` rows inside a stock `Alert`, so
// you had to compare three numerals by eye.
//
// The canon already specifies the shape for that question, and it already
// ships: `components/cellular/antenna-alignment/recorder-card.tsx` draws its
// position comparison as rows on ONE shared 0-100 scale, so "which won" is read
// by BAR LENGTH at a glance. Three bars in three separate boxes are three
// readings; three bars in a stack are a comparison.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE THIRD ROW IS A REFERENCE, NOT A CONTESTANT
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Line speed measures the class of traffic ISPs usually do NOT throttle (Ookla,
// falling back to Cloudflare), so a low fast.com beside a healthy reference
// means real CDN throttling while a slow reference means the line itself is
// slow (docs/reference/dpi.md > Verify). It shares the scale so it can be read
// against the other two, but it can never be the WINNER — the winner answers
// "did the bypass help", and the line speed is not competing in that.
