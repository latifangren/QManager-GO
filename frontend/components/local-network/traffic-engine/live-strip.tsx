// =============================================================================
// LiveStrip — the four live tiles under the page header
// =============================================================================
// Replaces `engine-status-card.tsx`, and the replacement is a correctness fix
// before it is a visual one.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RETIRED CARD COULD REPORT THE WRONG MODE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The shell read `videoOptimizer.data ?? fullBypass.data` and the card then
// picked its own shape from `"sni_domain" in data`. Both hooks fetch, so the
// Video Optimizer's payload was essentially always present and always won —
// which meant that with MASQUERADE enabled the card still rendered the Video
// Optimizer layout and showed "Domains loaded", a figure for a mode that has no
// domain list (docs/reference/dpi.md > Modes).
//
// The strip does not sniff anything. The shell derives ONE `mode` from the two
// `enabled` flags and passes it in, so there is a single answer to "which mode
// is active" and every tile reads it. That single answer is also what makes the
// three-way selector possible; the two are the same change.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE CLOCK, AND THE FAILURE STATES LIVE ABOVE IT
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every figure here comes from the same 2s GET, so a failed read is a property
// of the whole strip rather than of one column of it. That is why the strip
// carries NO failure branch of its own: a read that never landed replaces the
// strip with one banner in the shell, and a poll that fails on top of data
// holds the figures — they are still the last thing the modem confirmed — and
// says so in a stale banner above them. Four identical "couldn't read" tiles
// would be one message repeated four times.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// COLOUR, AND THE ONE AMBIENT LOOP
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every body is `TILE.BODY`; there is no `tone` prop to make an exception. Two
// discs move at runtime — the engine's and the redirect rule's — because they
// are the only two things here with a functional state. Processed and Scope are
// counts, and a count is neutral (see `shapes.ts` for why the comp's `downlink`
// and `spatial` discs were not taken).
//
// The engine disc carries the surface's ONLY ambient loop, and it is gated on
// the engine genuinely RUNNING rather than on the page having loaded. The three
// engine states never share a glyph: `success-container` and `warning-container`
// measure 1.03:1 apart and are identical under deuteranopia, so the glyph is the
// channel that actually carries the state.
// =============================================================================
