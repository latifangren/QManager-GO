// =============================================================================
// TTL & MTU — shared geometry and tone contract
// =============================================================================
// The `/local-network/ttl-mtu-settings` family's FIRST shapes module, and the
// THIRD under `/local-network/` — `ethernet/shapes.ts` landed at 2511953 and
// `traffic-engine/shapes.ts` at 0fdfc65, so the convention here is inherited
// rather than invented.
//
// The finding this module exists to close is number 13 of the approved
// proposal: there was no shapes module on this route at all. Geometry was
// restated inline, which is how the page ended up with a skeleton promising
// `h-8 w-48` plus two `h-10` boxes against a loaded form of a switch row, two
// 42px fields and a 42px button — a handoff that jumps by whatever the form
// happens to resolve to that render (The Skeleton-Mirror Rule).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE GEOMETRY IS RESTATED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `components/cellular/tile-shape.ts` holds the identical tile box, and the two
// sibling modules under `/local-network/` hold most of the rest of this file
// almost verbatim. Nothing here imports any of them. `/local-network/` must not
// reach into `components/cellular/`, and sibling families restate from each
// other rather than sharing, because what is shared is the SYSTEM's numbers, not
// a module — a shared module makes one family's next correction silently
// everybody's (DESIGN.md > Layout).
//
// The values below are the system's, verbatim:
//
//   104px pinned tile   28px radius   52px disc   42px control   36px card
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// COLOUR: NEUTRAL BODIES, COLOUR ONLY ON THE DISC
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every tile body is `TILE.BODY` and there is deliberately no `tone` prop for a
// caller to override it with. A disc changes tone only when the thing it stands
// for has a real functional state, which on this band means "is an override
// actually in force". A TTL that is not being rewritten is not a fault and not a
// warning — it is the carrier's own value, which is the normal, correct resting
// state of a modem — so it takes the neutral disc (The Neutral-Default Rule).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RADIUS MAPPING
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The role scale, mapped by SHAPE ROLE rather than by nearest number:
//
//   36px  card shell        -> `rounded-card` — both cards are PEERS
//   28px  tile, row group   -> `rounded-tile`
//   20px  row               -> `rounded-field`
//   999px fields, chips     -> `rounded-pill`
//
// `rounded-hero` is "the ONE card that anchors a surface". The anchor here is
// the band, so neither write card wears it. The retired cards wore the raw
// `card.tsx` primitive instead — `rounded-xl border shadow-sm`, i.e. a 12px
// radius, a hairline over a fill, and a shadow outside the vocabulary entirely.
// =============================================================================
