// =============================================================================
// IP Passthrough — shared geometry and tone contract
// =============================================================================
// The `/local-network/ip-passthrough` family's first shapes module, and the
// THIRD under `/local-network/` — `ethernet/shapes.ts` (2511953) and
// `traffic-engine/shapes.ts` (0fdfc65) landed first, so the convention here is
// inherited rather than invented.
//
// What this module prevents, on this route specifically: the retired card
// restated its own page grid, its own header type, five bare `SelectTrigger`s
// and a nine-`Skeleton` loading state that mirrored nothing. Not one number in
// it was the system's.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE GEOMETRY IS RESTATED RATHER THAN IMPORTED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `components/cellular/tile-shape.ts` holds the identical tile box, and the two
// sibling `/local-network/` modules hold it again. This file deliberately
// imports none of them. `/local-network/` must not reach into
// `components/cellular/`, and a sibling family's module is not a shared library
// — what is shared is the SYSTEM's numbers, not a module. The values below are
// those numbers, verbatim:
//
//   104px pinned tile   28px radius   52px disc   42px control   36px card
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE BAND ON THIS PAGE REPORTS CONFIGURATION, NOT A MEASUREMENT
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the one place this family departs from its two siblings, and it is a
// COPY rule rather than a geometry rule, recorded here because it is the thing
// most likely to be quietly broken by a later edit.
//
// `ip_passthrough.sh` (GET) reads `/etc/qmanager/ippt_config.json` first — a
// file written by our own POST — and falls back to poller fields
// (`device.ippt_*`) captured once at boot. No AT command is issued on GET. So
// Band A reports WHAT QMANAGER LAST APPLIED, not what the modem is doing right
// now, and every string on it is written in the language of configuration:
// "Set to…", "Pinned by…", "Saved as…". Never "currently", "live", "on the
// wire", "verified". The band's own label is "Last applied" for the same
// reason. A band that reads as a measurement while sourcing a config file is
// the State-Honesty Rule broken in the one direction a user cannot detect.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// COLOUR: NEUTRAL BODIES, AND ONLY THE MODE DISC MOVES
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every tile body is `TILE.BODY` and there is no `tone` prop to override it.
// Colour lives on the 52px disc, and only the MODE disc picks a tone at
// runtime, because passthrough-vs-router is the only thing on this strip with a
// functional state. NAT and DNS proxy are saved settings, and the target MAC is
// an identifier; none of the three has a healthy or degraded reading to report,
// so all three take `DISC_TONE.neutral` under The Neutral-Default Rule. A
// colour that never changes encodes nothing.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RADIUS MAPPING
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The role scale, mapped by SHAPE ROLE rather than by nearest number:
//
//   36px  card shell    -> `rounded-card` — a PEER card; the band is the anchor
//   28px  tile, group   -> `rounded-tile`
//   20px  row           -> `rounded-field`
//   999px chips, fields -> `rounded-pill`
//
// `rounded-hero` is "the ONE card that anchors a surface". The anchor here is
// Band A, so the single write card is a peer.

 * it survives review.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DARK FILL IS EXPLICIT **AND** IMPORTANT-MARKED
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `select.tsx` ships its own `dark:bg-input/30`. Writing an unprefixed fill
 * loses in dark mode outright (that rule is (0,2,0) too). Writing the `dark:`
 * half is necessary and still not sufficient: once BOTH rules are
 * `dark:`-prefixed they TIE, and a tie is decided by emission order — Tailwind's
 * deterministic name sort, where `bg-input…` precedes `bg-surface-…` only
 * because *i* precedes *s*. That is an observed outcome, not a constructed one,
 * so the dark half carries the important modifier and wins by construction
 * instead of by alphabet.
 *
 * The primitives' `rounded-md` / `h-9` / `dark:bg-input/30` remain an OPEN
 * product-wide Migration Delta. This corrects them at these call sites and does
 * not sweep them; migrating the primitive retires both markers with it.
 *
 * THE FILL IS ONE STEP ABOVE **THIS** HOST. The control sits inside a `ROW`,
 * inside `ROW_GROUP`, which is `bg-surface-container` — so
 * `surface-container-high` is exactly host + 1. On a borderless field the fill
 * IS the whole affordance; get the step wrong and the control renders at
