// =============================================================================
// SegmentedField — a pill group above the card breakpoint, a Select below it
// =============================================================================
// Replaces a bare `<Select>` for binary and three/four-way choices, so a radio
// kill switch and a roaming preference stop looking like the same control.
//
// WHY THE FILL TRAVELS RATHER THAN CROSS-FADES. Segments have unequal label
// widths ("Automatic" vs "LTE only"), so two stacked fills fading into each
// other visibly jump. One `motion.span` rendered inside whichever segment is
// active, sharing a `layoutId`, makes Motion tween the BOX between positions —
// which also means nothing here animates `width` (DESIGN.md > Transform-Only).
//
// THE layoutId MUST BE INSTANCE-SCOPED. This surface renders six of these at
// once — three rows in each of two write cards. A module-constant id makes every
// thumb share one layout group and fling across the card on first paint. `useId`
// scopes it per instance.
//
// EVERY SEGMENT RESERVES THE CHECK GLYPH, AND THAT IS THE FIX. The thumb is
// `absolute inset-0`, so its box IS the segment's box. The glyph plus `gap-1.5`
// is worth 21.7px and used to render only on the ACTIVE segment, which meant a
// click changed BOTH ends of the animation Framer was computing, mid-flight:
// measured first frame `translate3d(-266.99px, 0, 0) scale(1.13606, 1)`, so the
// pill stretched 14% while it travelled and its caps read as ellipses. The label
// you clicked slid 21.8px out from under your cursor, un-animated, and the rest
// of the track reshuffled as a hard cut while the one animated thing glided for
// 600ms. The glyph now renders on every segment and hides with
// `SEGMENTED.GLYPH_RESERVED` (opacity + scale, never `display` or a conditional
// render — both of those give the box back).
//
// THERE IS NO FIRST-PAINT GUARD ANY MORE, and its removal is the point rather
// than an omission. It ran one rAF frame at zero duration on mount to stop the
// thumb sliding in from nowhere. That fling was caused by the layoutId being a
// MODULE CONSTANT; `useId` fixed it, and the guard has been dead weight ever
// since — rendered settled from first paint the thumb carries only
// `style="opacity: 1;"` at mount, because a `layoutId` node with no predecessor
// in its stack has no snapshot to animate from. It was a live violation of
// DESIGN.md > The Non-Load-Bearing Rule. `initial={false}` is NOT its
// replacement: that governs enter animations of animated VALUES, not layout
// projection, and adding it would substitute a prop for a mechanism.
//
// THE SELECT IS NOT A DEGRADED FALLBACK. Four segments do not fit one row on a
// phone, and shrinking them under a 44px touch target is not an option on a
// surface field techs use on a tablet in the field. Both controls are bound to
// the same state; below the breakpoint the Select IS the control.
