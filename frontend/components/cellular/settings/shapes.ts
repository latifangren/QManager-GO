// Cellular settings — shared geometry and tone contract
// =============================================================================
// Single source of truth for this surface family's shapes. Every consumer
// imports from here, INCLUDING the skeletons — a skeleton that restates a
// number has left the contract (The Skeleton-Mirror Rule).
//
// SCOPE. This began as the contract for Cellular Basic Settings alone. It now
// governs five routes under `/cellular/settings/`: the basic settings page,
// APN Management, Network Priority, IMEI Settings and Blocked Networks. The
// four latecomers were each carrying their own hand-rolled geometry (legacy
// `rounded-xl`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-muted/30` washes) — adopting this
// file is what makes them one surface rather than four that merely sit under
// one nav group. Anything genuinely shared belongs here; anything true of ONE
// page stays in that page's own module.
//
// This file exists because the surface it replaces had the defect in miniature:
// the loading branch of `cellular-settings-card.tsx` hand-restated `h-4 w-36`
// and `h-9 w-full` per field, and its skeleton `CardTitle` read "Cellular Basic
// Settings" while the loaded card read "Modem Radio Settings" — a visible title
// swap on every load, invisible in review because the two strings sat 46 lines
// apart. Naming both from one place is what stops that recurring.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RADIUS MAPPING FROM THE APPROVED COMP
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The comp is drawn in raw pixels; this surface ships the role scale. The map is
// by SHAPE ROLE, not by nearest number:
//
//   comp 32px  card shell        -> `rounded-card`  (36px)
//   comp 26px  row group         -> `rounded-tile`  (28px)
//   comp 22px  promoted row      -> `rounded-field` (20px)
//   comp 999px chips, segments   -> `rounded-pill`
//
// A promoted row is deliberately a step TIGHTER than the group that contains it.
// Radius-Follows-Size means the inner thing is rounder-per-pixel but smaller in
// absolute radius; matching the group's 28px would make the promoted row read as
// a sibling of its own container.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TONE RULE ON THIS SURFACE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Rows stay NEUTRAL at rest and while dirty. The DELTA_CHIP ("SIM 1 -> SIM 2")
// is the row's one indicator of an unsaved edit — a `bg-primary` pill is
// already the brand acting, and repeating that signal as a full-row
// `primary-container` fill restated the same fact twice on one row.
//
// This was a promote-on-dirty container fill until 2026-08-30: see
// docs/reference/cellular-settings-family.md's "Rows are neutral..." section
// for the retired rule and why it existed. Removing it also retired every
// `_ON_FILL` control twin it required (`SEGMENTED.SEGMENT_ON_FILL` /
// `.TRACK_ON_FILL`, `SELECT_TRIGGER_ON_FILL`, `FIELD_SHELL_ON_FILL`) — a
// control never needs an ink pair for a container it can no longer sit on.
//
// No row carries a border. Separation between rows is a hairline DIVIDER inside
// the group (`bg-surface-container-high`).

 * A write column beside the read-only workbench that feeds it.
 *
 * The two columns sit side by side for a functional reason rather than a
 * decorative one: the workbench generates an identifier the user then types into
 * the write field, so both have to be on screen at once.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ROW TEMPLATE IS THE FIX. `items-start` WAS NOT.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This grid is two rows: the left column stacks the two write cards one per row
 * and the workbench spans both. With both tracks left `auto`, a spanning item's
 * height is distributed ACROSS the tracks it spans — so a workbench taller than
 * the two write cards combined pushed the row-2 grid line down and opened a
 * ~90px void between "Device IMEI" and "Backup IMEI". Nothing in this file
 * declared that space and no gap value could remove it. Two sibling cards in one
 * column drifting apart because a THIRD card in the next column got taller is
 * the antipattern; the distance between them has to be the family's regular
 * `gap-4` in every state.
 *
 * `grid-rows-[auto_1fr]` fixes it at the source. Row 1 sizes to the device card
 * and nothing else, so the gap below it is exactly the grid gap. Row 2 is the
 * flexible track, so all of the spanning card's surplus lands there, where the
 * backup card absorbs it by STRETCHING rather than by being pushed.
 *
 * ON THE HEIGHT LOCK. `items-start` is gone by explicit request — the two
 * columns now match. A height lock between cards is normally a split by
 * SYMMETRY, which DESIGN.md > Layout names as a defect, and what makes it safe
 * HERE is arithmetic rather than taste: with the workbench's redundant prefix
 * row retired and its check field collapsed from two rows to one input group,
 * the columns land within a few tens of pixels of each other at rest. The lock
 * closes a rounding error; it is not pinning a static reference card to a live
 * telemetry one. The workbench spends its residual slack on purpose — see
 * `CARD_BODY_FILL` — rather than trailing it as a void. If a future row pushes
 * either column materially past the other, revisit this rather than letting a
 * card grow a hole.
 *

/**
 * The four glance tiles that replaced the 826-line "Current Connection" hero.
 *
 * WHY A STRIP AND NOT A CARD. The hero asked the wrong question. A settings
 * surface is opened to answer "what is this modem set to, and what happens if I
 * touch this?" — the hero instead led with AMBR, the network-granted rate
 * ceiling, across two of its three columns. AMBR is the most specialist number
 * on the page, is not settable anywhere on it, and none of the six writable
 * fields can move it. Eighteen distinct facts rendered in one card.
 *
 * THE RAIL RAN A GENERATION THE FAMILY DELETED TWICE. `HERO_RAIL_TONE.NR` was
 * `bg-primary text-primary-foreground` painted across a full-width block.
 * `radio/summary-tiles.tsx` documents five generations of exactly that shape:
 * Gen 2 measured it live at 623x212 = 132,033px^2 carrying 9,526px^2 of ink
 * (7.2%) and called it "a large empty purple slab"; GEN 5 REMOVED BODY TINT
 * ENTIRELY — "Every tile body is now NEUTRAL_TILE and the disc is the only
 * coloured element on the strip." The hero's own JSDoc cited that file as its
 * precedent while running the composition it had abandoned. So the geometry
 * comes from `components/cellular/tile-shape.ts` (the 104px pin, the 52px disc)
 * and the tone rule comes with it: `BODY` is the only body fill on this strip,
 * and every hue lives on a `DISC_*` key.
 *
 * ONE CLOCK. Every fact in a tile is read from the poller snapshot, which ticks
 * continuously, so the freshness chip in `HEAD` is honest about the whole band —
 * which is what the retired `HERO_FOOTNOTE` existed to apologise for. The rate
 * ceiling, which runs on the settings GET and does not tick, is a separate band
 * with its own provenance line (`RATE_CEILING` below). No surface here holds two
 * clocks.
 *
 * THE SIM TILE DELIBERATELY OVERLAPS THE `sim_slot` CONTROL BELOW IT, and that
 * is the point rather than a duplication: the tile reports the slot the modem is
 * ON (poller), the control holds the slot the user has ASKED FOR (settings).
 * During the ~35s slot apply they legitimately disagree, and a technician needs
 * to see both. The two facts the hero really did render twice — radio power and
 * the active slot as read-only `ParamRow`s over the same `saved` object the
 * control below was bound to — are gone.
 *
 * THE EMPTY STATE IS PER TILE, not a branch of the strip. A modem with no
 * carrier name, no APN and no aggregation is a fully successful read of a real
 * device state; each tile states its own absence as a fact ("No carrier
 * reported") rather than the band collapsing into one empty screen. The strip's
 * own third state is a FAILED read, which takes `NOTICE_*`.

 *
 * The chip now sits INSIDE `LABEL_ROW`, beside the label, on a row that is
 * `items-center` and `min-h`-floored to the chip's own 1.375rem. An invisible
 * chip is zero-width and shorter than the label's line box, so on every row this
 * surface actually renders it adds NOTHING to the height in either state — the
 * reservation is still there, it is just horizontal now.
 *
 * The residual, stated rather than hidden: the label is allowed to WRAP
 * (`min-w-0`, never truncated — clipping a setting's name is worse than a
 * reflow), so a text column narrow enough that `label + chip` will not fit on
 * one line can still gain a line on promotion. That needs the longest shipped
 * label (Italian, "Rilevamento sostituzione SIM a caldo", ~270px) beside the
 * ~120px chip inside a text column under ~400px, which happens only on a phone.
 * The old failure was a guaranteed 30px jump at 760px AND 1500px body width;
 * this one is a possible 22px jump in one locale at one size, and the control
 * is stacked BELOW the text there rather than `items-center` beside it, so it
 * does not half-shift the segmented thumb the way the old one did.

 * 5rem. The old floor was 6.125rem and included the chip's retired line; keeping

/**
 * The pill-group / Select switch, parameterised by the card step it keys off.

 * WHY A FACTORY. The basic settings page used to hold all six rows in one wide
 * card; it now holds three rows in each of two narrower peers, and the family's
 * default `@2xl/card` step (42rem) would push a half-width card onto the Select
 * fallback at desktop widths where the old single card showed the pill group —
 * a silent control change on exactly the widths a desktop review looks at.
 *
 * THE CLASSES MUST BE LITERAL. Tailwind's scanner only compiles class names it
 * finds verbatim in source, so the map below is written out in full — a
 * template string like `` @${step}/card:flex `` produces NO rule, which once
 * shipped as exactly that: the pill group silently vanished at every width and
 * every SegmentedField rendered only its Select. If a step is added, the four
 * strings for it must be spelled out, never interpolated.
 *
 * The ROW keeps its own `@2xl/card` step: between the two breakpoints a row is
 * stacked (text above control) and the pill group renders full-width under it,
 * which is the same arrangement a phone already shows.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY `5xl` EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS ONE ROW'S STEP RATHER THAN THE FAMILY'S
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A step ABOVE the row's own flip is not a contradiction — it is the only place
 * a fallback can live. `SETTING_ROW.ROOT` flips stacked -> side-by-side at
 * `@2xl/card` (672px), and it is exactly THERE that the text column collapses
 * against a wide track. Below 672 the control is full-width under the text and
 * nothing competes; above 672 the two share one line and the widest control on
 * the surface takes the text column's share.
 *
 * Reserving the check glyph on every segment (see `GLYPH_RESERVED`) widened the
 * four-segment track from ~386px to 452px, which turned a pre-existing squeeze
 * into a visible one. Measured on the real component (`SettingRow` +
 * `SegmentedField`, English, card container width swept directly), the
 * `mode_pref` row — the only four-way row, and the only one that can render
 * FIVE segments when the modem reports a value we do not offer:
 *
 *   card px  |  4 segments (`lg`)      |  5 segments (`lg`)
 *   ---------|-------------------------|-----------------------
 *   672      |  102px text, 3 lines    |    0px text, 6 lines, 249px row
 *   700      |  130px text, 2 lines    |    0px text, 6 lines, 249px row
 *   740      |  170px text, 2 lines    |    0px text, 6 lines, 249px row
 *   800      |  230px text, 2 lines    |   57px text, 5 lines, 229px row
 *   860      |  290px text, 1 line     |  117px text, 3 lines, 166px row
 *   896      |  326px text, 1 line     |  153px text, 2 lines, 146px row
 *   1024     |  454px text, 1 line     |  281px text, 1 line,  103px row
 *
 * That is `SETTING_ROW.TEXT`'s own documented failure arriving for real: a
 * 249px row of one-word lines, at widths a desktop review actually looks at.
 *
 * WHY 64rem AND NOT 56rem. `@4xl` (896px) was measured too and does clear the
 * four-segment case, but the five-segment case only crosses into two lines at
 * 870px — 26px of margin — and returns the pill group into a 146px row, 43px
 * above the row's own 102.8px floor. At `@5xl` (1024px) BOTH the four- and
 * five-segment cases render one consequence line in a 102.8px row at every card
 * width from 672 up: the control change and the row settling coincide, which is
 * what makes the switch read as a layout decision rather than a symptom.
 *
 * THE OTHER FIVE ROWS KEEP `lg`. Two- and three-segment tracks are 309px at
 * most and are not the offender — `nr5g_mode` measured identically (244.7px
 * text / 3 lines / 143.4px row at 672) before and after this change. Demoting

 * An identifier field whose actions ride INSIDE it — one row, one box.

 * WHERE IT IS USED. The workbench's "Check a number" field. Copy and "Look up

 * its own line: neither action is a decision, both operate on the value in the
 * field above them, and stacked they read as a toolbar for the whole section
 * rather than as two things you can do to this number. Folded in, the field
 * states its own affordances and the section loses a row it was only spending on
 * furniture. Actions bracket the value: the outbound link leads, the number is
 * the content, copy closes.
 *
 * WHY NOT `components/ui/input-group.tsx`. The stock primitive is a hairline
 * `border` over `rounded-md` with `dark:bg-input/30` and `text-muted-foreground`
 * — a stroke where this system uses a fill (The No-Hairline-On-Fill Rule), the
 * legacy `--radius` chain where this system uses the role scale, and precisely
 * the `dark:`-scoped fill that `FIELD_VOICE`'s own note documents as surviving
 * an unprefixed override through tailwind-merge. Overriding it back would mean
 * restating every one of this file's numbers as a `dark:` variant. The group is
 * therefore composed from `CONTROL_BOX` like every other control here, so it is
 * the SAME 42px pill as the fields above it rather than a lookalike.
 *
 * THE RING MOVED TO THE SHELL. The input inside is transparent and unringed —
 * a ring drawn around a child that fills only the middle of the box would trace
 * a rectangle through the middle of a pill. `has-[input:focus-visible]` puts the
 * ring on the group, so the whole control lights up as one object, which is what
 * it is to the user.
 *
 * THE LEAD LABEL IS CONTAINER-GATED, NOT DROPPED. Below `@md/card` — which is
 * every phone, and also the workbench's own column at the `@4xl/main` step where
 * the split first turns on — a 15-digit mono identifier plus a labelled pill
 * plus a copy target will not fit on one line, and the field would scroll its
 * own value out of sight. The label hides there and the glyph carries the action
 * (the `aria-label` is unconditional, so the accessible name never changes).
 * `@md/card` is the step this card already uses for `BREAKDOWN.GRID` — see
 * DESIGN.md > The Grid-Step-Costing Rule: costed against the COLUMN, not the page.

 *    exactly one consumer, the skeleton it was lying to, so it is deleted
 *    rather than corrected: a second magic number is a second thing to get
 *    wrong. (A skeleton still cannot know how far the copy wraps; matching the
 *    one-line row is the honest floor, and it is now exact.)
 *
 * 2. THE RADIUS DID NOT RESOLVE. The call site passed `rounded-field` to a
 *    `Skeleton` whose own base string ends `rounded-md`. `cn()` is bare
 *    tailwind-merge and it cannot dedupe THIS REPO'S CUSTOM radius names, so
 *    both utilities survived into the class list and the winner was CSS
 *    declaration order — alphabetical, so `rounded-md` (10.4px) beat
 *    `rounded-field` (20px) on every render. The skeleton drew corners half the
 *    size of the row it stood in for, and nothing errored. `rounded-pill` wins
 *    that same coin-flip, which is why the slivers below need no escape hatch
 *    and the bar did.

 * work with no second channel, which was safe only for as long as the block

/**
 * A single down/up rate chip.
 *
 * DIRECTION IS THE COLOUR, NOT THE RADIO. An earlier draft coloured both
 * chips after the block's radio identity (`bg-lte` inside the LTE block,
 * `bg-primary` inside the 5G block) — which is why an LTE download chip and
 * an LTE upload chip were the same purple, distinguished only by their arrow
 * glyph. A figure's DIRECTION now reads the same colour regardless of which
 * radio block it sits in — the radio identity still lives one layer out from the
 * chip, on the block's own identity `Tag` — and the two hues carrying that
 * direction belong to neither radio.
 *
 * WHY ROSE AND CYAN, AND NOT BLUE AND VIOLET. An earlier pass used `primary`
 * (download) and `lte` (upload), reasoning that cyan read as a discordant third
 * accent sitting inside the violet LTE block. That observation was true and the
 * conclusion was still wrong: it fixed a local adjacency by spending the two
 * RADIO identity hues on a fact that is not about radios. Inside the LTE block
 * an upload chip then rendered in the LTE hue for reasons having nothing to do
 * with LTE, and blue meant 5G NR, the brand, "in progress" AND download
 * depending on which page you were reading.
 *
 * Direction now has its own axis: Downlink Rose (hue 341) and Uplink Cyan (hue
 * 200), neither of which can be confused for a radio. The chips sit ON the
 * block's radio container rather than borrowing from it, which is what makes a
 * rose download chip inside the violet LTE block legible as two independent
 * facts instead of one muddled one. Hue 341 is not a taste pick — sweeping the
 * full circle against every taken hue leaves exactly one window clearing the
 * 40-degree floor.
 *
 * The arrow glyph stays as the direction's SECOND channel (never the only
 * one — PRODUCT.md requires a paired readout to survive colour-blindness),
 * so the pairing degrades gracefully rather than depending on hue alone. That
 * matters more than it looks: at container lightness in dark mode this
 * system's tonal pairs collapse under deuteranopia and protanopia simulation,
 * so on a dark block the arrow is the information and the hue is reinforcement.
 *
 * ON THE FILL CHOICE. An earlier draft wrote `bg-lte/25` and `bg-primary/25`.
 * Both are alpha washes, and this file's Tone Rule forbids them: an alpha is a
 * different perceived lightness in each theme. The correct move for a chip
 * that must lift off a CONTAINER is the role's own FILL pair — `bg-downlink`
 * carries `text-downlink-foreground`, `bg-uplink` carries
 * `text-uplink-foreground`, a real pair in both themes. Note the pairs are
 * declared here, so consumers must NOT also set an ink class on the chip.
