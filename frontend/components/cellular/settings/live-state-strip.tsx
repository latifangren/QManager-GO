// =============================================================================
// LiveStateStrip — Band A of /cellular/settings
// =============================================================================
// Four tiles under the page header: Network, SIM, Aggregation, Data path. It
// replaces `ModemHeroCard`, an 826-line anchor card that led with AMBR — the
// network-granted rate ceiling, which is the most specialist number on the page,
// is not settable anywhere on it, and cannot be moved by any of the six writable
// fields below. Eighteen distinct facts rendered in that one card.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE CLOCK, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE SPLIT
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every figure in every tile is read from the poller snapshot
// (`/tmp/qmanager_status.json`, ~4s), so the STALE chip in the band header is
// honest about the entire band (there is no "live" chip any more — see the
// header block for why the healthy half was retired and the warning kept). The hero could not say that: its rail ran on
// the poller while two of its three columns ran on the settings GET, which does
// not tick at all — which is why it needed two readiness flags, two failure
// branches, a freshness chip deliberately scoped to one band, and a footnote
// whose own JSDoc admitted "the hero has TWO CLOCKS and one of them does not
// tick". The rate ceiling now lives in its own band with its own provenance
// line, and that footnote is deleted rather than reworded.
//
// The ONE fact here that does not come from the poller is `dualSlot`, in the SIM
// tile's caption. It is not a second clock in the sense that mattered: which
// physical card sits in the other slot is a hardware fact that changes when
// someone opens the device, not a reading that goes stale between polls. It is
// also allowed to disagree with the tile's own value during a slot apply — see
// below, where that disagreement is the information.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SIM TILE DELIBERATELY OVERLAPS THE `sim_slot` CONTROL BELOW IT
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is not the duplication the hero had. The hero rendered radio power and
// the active slot as read-only rows sourced from `saved` — the exact object the
// controls ~400px below were bound to, so the two could never disagree and the
// row said nothing the control did not. Radio power is gone from this band
// entirely for that reason.
//
// The slot stays, and switches source. The TILE reports the slot the modem is
// ON (poller); the CONTROL holds the slot the user has ASKED FOR (settings). A
// SIM-slot apply takes ~35s, and for that whole window the two legitimately
// disagree — which is precisely the moment a technician needs to see both.
//
// The cost is stated rather than hidden: the poller SEEDS `network.sim_slot` to
// 1 for roughly the first 60s of its life, so a freshly started poller can show
// "SIM 1" before the modem was ever asked. That is the same class of defect the
// settings GET has (`settings.sh` seeds `sim_slot=1` / `cfun=1` and still
// returns `success:true`), so neither source can currently express "not read";
// the poller is chosen here because the question this tile asks is a live one.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// IDENTITY LIVES ON THE DISC, NEVER ON A TILE BODY
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `radio/summary-tiles.tsx` reached this through five generations: Gen 2's
// full-width tonal slab measured 623x212 = 132,033px^2 carrying 7.2% ink, and
// Gen 5 removed body tint outright. The hero's rail was that slab, and its own
// JSDoc cited that file as its precedent. Every body here is `STRIP.BODY`; the
// disc is the only coloured element. An unidentified radio (`network.type ===
// ""`) takes the NEUTRAL disc and never claims the 5G blue.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE STATE-HONESTY BURDEN, CARRIED FORWARD FROM THE HERO
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   `network.type` can legitimately be `""` — the serving-cell parse produced no
//                  identifiable RAT. `networkTypeLabel("")` returns "Unknown"
//                  and cannot return "LTE".
//   `carrier`      empty means the poller has published no operator name, which
//                  is NOT the same as "not registered": it is a Tier-2 field
//                  seeded to "" at poller start, so a fully attached modem
//                  reports "" for the first ~60s. The copy states the READ ("No
//                  carrier reported"), never the registration state.
//   `apn`          empty is reported the same way, for the same reason.
//   `.sim`         absent on any device OTA-upgraded from an older poller; falls
//                  back to the `unknown` tone. `sim.status` is the reliable
//                  channel — `sim.inserted` is `0 | 1 | null` on the wire
//                  against a `boolean` type and must not be read.
//   `dualSlot`     `null` is the honest "the modem cannot answer the dual-slot
//                  AT query at all". The caption is OMITTED rather than filled
//                  with a placeholder.
