 * match for it: both are write surfaces of comparable weight (a handful of
 * rows plus a save bar), and MBN's own bundle list is height-capped at
 * `CHOICE_ROW.SCROLL_CAP` (17rem) rather than growing unbounded, so the
 * "dead space in whichever card has less to say" failure mode the rule warns
 * about does not reproduce here the way it did for AMBR. Kept page-local
 * rather than promoted to `../shapes` — nothing else on this surface pairs a
 * fieldset-wrapped card with a plain one.

// Three full-width bands under the page header. The page arranges bands; it
// never becomes the canvas.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE FAMILY'S GRAMMAR: live state -> what you can change -> the
// commit. It used to run backwards — header, then the write card and MBN side
// by side, then "What the network granted" LAST, so the negotiated truth (the
// only thing here that can answer "is my connection actually dialling the APN I
// think it is") was filed at the bottom behind the heaviest card on the
// surface. `/cellular/settings` ships the correct order and is the reference.
//
//   Band A  What the network granted   poller clock, isStale, the comparison
//   Band B  APN configuration          settings GET, inside the override gate
//   Band C  Carrier bundle (MBN)       its own GET, outside the gate
//
// BAND B AND BAND C SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON DESKTOP, matched to one height by the
// page-local `WRITE_CELL`. `PAGE_GRID` — the OLD two-column grid inherited
// from `/cellular/settings`, whose 1.35fr/1fr ratio was justified by a right
// column ("AMBR + modem reports") this page never had — is still gone, and
// for the reason DESIGN.md gives: SPLIT A PAGE BY CADENCE, NOT BY SYMMETRY.
// That argument was against pairing a write card with a read-only reference
// block on an unrelated clock. B and C are a different pairing: two write
// surfaces of comparable weight, each with its own save bar, and MBN's own
// list is height-capped (`CHOICE_ROW.SCROLL_CAP`) rather than open-ended — so
// side by side does not strand the dead space the rule warns about. See
// `WRITE_GRID` / `WRITE_CELL` below for the mechanics. `PAGE_GRID` itself
// stays exported — `imei-settings.tsx` still consumes it for its own pairing.
//
// THREE DATA SOURCES, DELIBERATELY SEPARATE:
//   useApnSettings   the writable APN CGI surface (one read on mount, re-read
//                    around a save)
//   useMbnSettings   the carrier-bundle CGI surface, on its own clock
//   useModemStatus   the read-only poller snapshot (~2s), and the ONLY source
//                    the "What the network granted" strip is allowed to use
//
// The last one is a new dependency for this route. It matters that it is
// separate: the APN card reports what was CONFIGURED, the strip reports what
// the network actually GRANTED, and collapsing them would let a stored value
// masquerade as a negotiated one.
//
// THE OVERRIDE GATE STAYS, AND NOW COVERS ONLY WHAT IT GOVERNS. When a Custom
// SIM Profile owns the APN, the APN write surface is read-only — the profile is
// the source of truth. The gate is a disabled <fieldset> rather than a
// `disabled` prop threaded through every child, and `overrideUndetermined`
// holds that card in its loading state until the verdict resolves, closing the
// window where every button is live before the lock engages.
//
// It used to wrap MBN as well. The gate fires on `profile.settings.apn.name`
// being non-empty, so a profile owning the APN disabled the carrier-bundle
// picker — a control no profile manages and which the profile system has
// nothing to say about. MBN is now outside it.
//
// Band A sits outside it too, and always did, on purpose. A profile owning the
// APN does not make the network's answer less true, and dimming live truth to
// 60% opacity would be the page hiding the one thing still worth reading.

// compression) — at a fifth of a card each, the two values a technician opened
// this page to read are exactly the two that truncate to noise. A
// label-left/value-right row gives the value the remaining width; see
// `READOUT_ROW.GRID` for the full reasoning.
//
// WHAT WAS REMOVED, AND WHY:
//   "Matches stored"      a badge asserting agreement between a stored value and
//                         a negotiated one. The page header's chip already
//                         reports exactly that, once.
//   "The context asked
//    for IPv4v6 and the
//    network answered…"   a sentence the page cannot derive without knowing
//                         which request produced this answer.
//   "Last APN write"      no such timestamp exists anywhere in the backend — the
//                         sidecar stores {apn, pdp_type, cid, active} and
//                         nothing else. Replaced by the IPv6 row, which is real.
//   "attached · LTE B3"   the band is Radio Information's job, and the dot is a
//                         glue character the No-Dot-Separator Rule forbids.

/**
 * The configured-vs-granted pair — the one comparison this page exists to draw,
 * finally drawn where both halves are visible at once.
 *
 * TWO BLOCKS, NOT FIVE TILES, for the same reason `READOUT_ROW.GRID` is not a
 * tile grid: the values are IDENTIFIERS. A block gives an APN the whole width
 * of its half rather than a fifth of a card, and wraps rather than truncating
 * when it still does not fit.
 *
 * THE TINT IS ON THE GRANTED SIDE ONLY. "What you asked for" cannot be right or
 * wrong — it is simply what is stored — so tinting it would spend a functional
 * role on a fact with no verdict attached. The granted block carries the
 * verdict because the granted block IS the verdict.
 *
 * EYEBROW AND PROVENANCE SET NO INK. They sit on three different fills
 * (`surface-container` neutral, `success-container` on agreement,
 * `destructive-container` on disagreement) and dim whatever the block already
 * carries, which is the only spelling that stays correct on all three — the
 * cross-pair (one role's ink on another role's container) is what this family
 * names as its most common contrast failure. Same mechanism as
 * `CHOICE_ROW.CAPTION`.
 *
 * THE VERDICT GLYPH RIDES THE VALUE LINE, not a row of its own below it — the
 * word ("Matches" / "Does not match") was redundant with the block's own fill
 * (`MATCH` / `DRIFT`) once both are visible at once, and dropping that row is
 * what lets `BLOCK` slim down. The glyph alone would fail the fill-is-not-the-
 * only-channel rule (`success-container` and `destructive-container` measure
 * close together and collapse under deuteranopia), so it stays a real glyph —
 * distinct per verdict — beside the value it is a verdict ABOUT, not a second
 * label restating the fill.
